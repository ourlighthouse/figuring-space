# Chapter V: Electrogeometric Space

On several occasions, and in particular in his work on the deduction of dynamic systems[^1], Schelling suggests a common genesis for spatial dimensions and magnetic and electrical phenomena. He draws up the chart:

| Magnetism | Length (stretching) |
| Electricity   | Width (spreading)  |

Schelling observes that length and magnetism appear in the intuition as a paralysed direction (a bar), whereas width and electricity exemplify a polarization where the separation is already finished (intuition of two sides or of two separable types of change in nature). To overcome this opposition between the two polarizations and to conceive of them in a single intuition, Schelling is driven to bring in a third dimension which makes it possible, through penetration, to articulate the 'stretching' with the 'spreading' and heralds the arrival of the electrogeometric space of nineteenth-century physics. 

The following analyses complete those conducted in the preceding chapter. Once more, a dialectical balance will make it possible to grasp an electrodynamic round-the-Two and to understand how Faraday and Maxwell dismiss diagrams more or less explicitly related to attraction-repulsion and the hegemony of the longitudinal, in favor of other intuitions and other *allusive devices* (like the solenoid and the axis-loop system) which, as Schelling's *Deduktion* demands, engage space completely and signify the victory of the lateral.[^2] The indifference centre is no longer posited as the geometrical middle of two 'material points', but emigrates to the heart of the interlaces and embraces its circuits.

## 1. Length and Magnetism
The length presents itself to the intuition as the 'biggest' of the dimensions, that along which my look can travel, quite happy to have found a 'hold'. The width offers itself unresistingly as a parametrage, as a mode of measurement totally external to the object: it is the dimension according to which this object appears most bulky and therefore it is the one that any tendency toward displacement will seize; it is enough to think of the perplexity that square or 'cubic' objects excite.

The length has no power of envelopment and attempts to embrace the object by laying units end to end. In this sense, it goes hand in hand with addition and is very often associated with the interval of time required for the completion of a journey. Indeed, the length is often measured from a given origin $O$, from which an interval has stretched itself out (see fig. 1).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-1.png]]

The length has very little to tell us about the gesture that unfolds it: it dismisses and flees the point $O$ from which it rises and Schelling could well have given it as a privileged figure of finitude, for the disequilibrium between the 'form' (the interval $OP$) and the 'root' ($O$) from which $OP$ seems to 'come out' is pushed to its limit.[^3] How are the roles between the origin and the interval to be rebalanced? The clichÃ© of $O$ stuck in the plane like a nail, on which a length can be hung, must be smashed: once again, it is necessary to invent another articulation. I can therefore decide to see two extremities spread out with its indifference centre: the length 'is in the process of being born'; it is no longer the simple outpouring of a transitivity in nature and in the mind. To be measured concretely, this opening out assumes the mobilization of an articulation with two 'sides': compasses or pincers. Hence I have thereby as it were propelled a hand by thought and one might be tempted to say that the pincers or compasses give a *point of view* to the hand, by associating an angle in which the interval is 'seen' with the grasp. The angle refers to a degree of embracing and allows the lateral to resume its rights. It invites a second dimension, another world where the geometer may virtually propel himself: the hand inhabits the angle and the angel incites the hand to open out into two sides (see fig. 2).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-2.png]]

We get the full measure of what distinguishes the ruler from the compasses and the angle. The ruler implies an end-to-end placement of standard measuring units, a manipulation of a piece of direction. The ruler is a transfer that has been frozen &mdash; a bar. It can be only the replica of the dimension that it claims to measure. It suffices imply to propel oneself the length of the object in thought, equipped with a reference sample (assumed to be perfectly rigid and manipulable) and a measurement is obtained by juxtaposition, which multiplies errors.

The length is content to be embodied in channels and segments which are endowed with two distinct extremities, but as it were are welded to the spread-out element embodied by the bar. We are thus in a better position to say precisely why the table at the beginning of this chapter places length and magnetism together. In his *Deduktion*, Schelling can write without hesitation:

> Length can absolutely only exist in the form of magnetism, where magnetism is generally what governs length in the construction of matter.[^4]

Like the interval, the magnet is a simple piece of dimension, a bar with two poles embedded in it: a North pole and a South pole. This terminology shows the conventional character of this polarization, which is simply pinned to matter like an orientation label.

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-3.png]]

The polarization is entirely subject to two distance markers that 'resemble' it, the 'true' North pole and the 'true' South pole. The orientation is not therefore decided by an autonomous process, but is simply imported from geographical totems and as it were deposited in the boreal and austral charges. Naturally, this location fails as soon as the bar is taken to one of the poles: a magnet makes it possible to preserve a relic of polarization but not to produce it. These 'charges' are not isolable; if I break a magnetized bar, I merely obtain two other bars; magnetic polarization resists division by two. The bars can therefore be split as one pleases (see fig. 4).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-4.png]]

The point $O$, where these charges would supposedly neutralize one another, is just a simple (abstract) geometrical middle, which can be reproduced at will, by simulating spatial division, 'indefinitely'. $O$ *articulates nothing*, which is why it can be 'nailed' in the extension at will, while remaining a prisoner of the magnetic matter. This extensive division of $O$ invites no dimension: $O$ is the fulcrum of nothing and neither carries away nor propagates anything. Not being isolable, the boreal and austral charges induce no current nor any superior mobile unit that might have made $O$ appear as the point where the north-south polarization opens out.

## 2. The Autonomy of the Indifference Centre: Width and Electricity

Associated with the width is the intuition of two autonomous sides, which are obtained by drawing the compass- or scissor-arms apart. These arms open and pivot around an articulation and therefore an indifference centre that propagates mobility, unlike that of a bar, which is sunk into the matter. With width, spatial polarization achieves autonomy. In the same way, electricity, with its charges that are separable by experiment, produces diagrams that are very different from those of magnetism.

With electricity and its isolable charges, it is at last possible to embody the negative. These charges function like 'algebraic' masses, capable of neutralizing one another and above all of permitting an *electrical splitting of zero*. The equation $0 = Q^+ + Q^-$ (where $Q^+$ and $Q^-$ are not zero) shows that the electrical zero opens out into an equilibrium (being able to induce a current, see below, fig. 7) and can by no means be reduced to an absence of matter. We should emphasize that such an equation would not permit any solutions involving Newtonian masses, which accumulate an entirely static positivity.

There is more: this electrical opening of the zero is graspable by a technical device that is capable of prolonging it. The battery invented by Volta is based on two observations:

- it is possible to divide zero into two opposite polarities by plunging two already oxidized metal plates (brass and zinc) into water;
- by arranging such a system in series, it is possible to increase the effects (see fig. 5).[^5]

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-5.png]]

The diagram in figure 5 is crucial, since it condenses almost all the issues of ambiguity and of the technical grasp of the around-the-Two. Any significant opening of zero induces its own spatiality, an 'around'. Just as the reequilibriation of the iteration or accumulation of masses involved a whole plane, the brutal emergence of two opposed polarities, of two 'opposites' can be compensated for by a current that exceeds them by going round them. Electrical positivity is not that of accumulation, but that of current that loops the around opened by separation. The era of the circuits has begun and it will come as no surprise if this device crystallizes a new type of intuition linked with the domination of oppositions by loops and bends.

Voltaic currents seriously damage the prestige of the mechanism which is derived from simple transfer and extensive division, to the benefit of lateral transitivities involving a multi-dimensional causality, liberated from the image of the mobile which 'goes' from $A$ to $B$ (see fig. 6).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-6.png]]

The metaphor of the positive and negative 'fluids' had attempted to counter the 'self-evidence' of the solid and manipulable units of mechanics: it had long been known that an 'infinitely subtle' fluid could spring in a flash between two points. But the positive and negative polarities, although 'fluid', remained embedded in matter like precious jewels that only deigned to show themselves by lightning in a Leyden jar. The polarities $Q^+$ and $Q^-$ were abolished in a flash of lightning.

We understand that the victory of the 'fluids' over the mechanism was thus a half-victory. The latter has much more to fear from Volta's battery, which domesticates the around that always envelops the birth of a Two. The disequilibrium produced by the cell and its forced polarizations is not easily reestablished if one has been successful in constructing a loop that, by indirectly connecting up the opposition produced by the cell, seizes another dimension: the loop creates an '*electrical width*' for the battery. For the loop, the separation is not annihilated in the rupture or neutralization. A new around has been grasped diagrammatically in nature and thought and we do indeed rediscover the creative ambiguity of the indifference centre is no longer a point, *it has turned itself into a loop* and provokes a revolution in the spatial intuition.

Electrodynamics, the theory of charges in motion, is born of the electrical explosion of the zero, which has no mechanical equivalent: a zero mass has no impulse[^6] and only the accumulation of masses can increase the effects; when they move in opposite directions, they induce an electrical *current* (see fig. 7).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-7.png]]

## 3. Electrical Helices
The electrical explosion of the zero and its looping are going to carry physicists towards what should be called *electrogeometry*, as soon as they verify that the electrical loop irradiates effects around itself, just as Argand's balance carried everything onto a plane around its arms. Henceforth it is the elements of current, closed circuits, infinite lines or interlacings of wires which hold the attention. That is why AmpÃ¨re continually substitutes a 'conductor folded into a helix' for the magnetized bar; the diagram of the solenoid is born:

> ... an assembly to which I have given the name electrodynamic solenoid, from the Greek word solenoides, whose meaning expresses precisely that which is shaped like a channel, that is to say the surface of the form on which all the circuits are to be found.[^7]

The solenoid *unwinds a loop around a channel*: it articulates electrically a length and an angle or, as we will see in what follows, a translation and a rotation. This articulation is going to make it possible to resolve the key question of electrophilosophy, the unity of electrical and magnetic forces (see fig. 8).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-8.png]]

Schelling had observed in this *Deduktion* that magnetism and electricity were opposed in a kind of dualism parallel to that of length and width. A bar appears as an undivided totality to the sensible intuition, as the magnetic charges that produce no separable forces, whereas the forces derived from positive or negative charges are separate but are not set down as identical for the intuition. The metaphysical problem was therefore: 'How can two forces be dynamically separate and set down as identical for the intuition at the same time?'[^8]

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-9.png]]

It is necessary to articulate the length (the frozen polarization) and the width (the torn-apart polarization). This can be achieved if one defines a fixed interval in order to produce a height. The helix makes it possible to capture a new dimension:

> The particular mediating link by which the two forces can be set down at the same time as non-identical and yet as combined for the intuition is not the line or the surface, but the space itself, that is to say the extensive magnitude in three dimensions [*nach drei Dimensionen ausgedehnte Grosse*].[^9]

The electrical helix and the solenoid do not just make it possible to smash the spatial clichÃ©s of  fluids concentrated around poles or points; they demonstrate that a current must appropriate a new spatial dimension. An electrical loop, even a plane, involves and orients the space completely. 

Ãrsted's famous experiment[^10] demonstrates the electrical grasp of an around-the-Two yet more disquieting than the balance or the lever (see fig. 9). We understand the unease of Ãrsted and his contemporaries faced with the irruption of a fierce laterality. AmpÃ¨re recalls there was an initial attempt to tame the latter via the clichÃ© of the vortex.[^11]

> The illustrious scientist [Ãrsted] who first saw a magnet's poles moved by the action of a conducting wire into dimensions perpendicular to those of this wire concluded from it that electrical matter turned around it and pushed these poles in the direction of its motion, exactly as Descartes had the matter of his vortices turn in the direction of the planetary revolutions.[^12]

This 'fluid' was therefore supposed to deflect the needle with its impact. But AmpÃ¨re refuses this lame compromise between mechanics, which always boils down to a transference of impulse, and the new electrodynamic forces; he takes a decisive gamble: to grasp the laterality of the circuits and their capacity to subjugate a third dimension by proposing an axial interpretation of magnetic polarizations.

We should first remember how a circuit drawn in a plane induces sides in the plane (see also chapter IV). An observer-witness being permanently placed (AmpÃ¨re's 'bonhomme'), the positive side (respectively negative) is the set of points where the circuit appears to him as being travelled anti-clockwise (respectively clockwise) (see fig. 10).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-10.png]]

One can likewise, uniquely define an arrow perpendicular to the circuit (a 'conventional normal') such that AmpÃ¨re's 'bonhomme', shot through from head to foot by the current, sees the arrow go in on his right to come out again on his left (see fig. 11). A conventional normal also makes it possible to choose between a 'front' face and a 'back' face or, which amounts to the same thing, between a 'negative' face (South face) into which the arrow goes and a 'positive' face (North face) from which it emerges (see fig. 12a). This leads to the equivalent rule of the corkscrew: an ordinary corkscrew, turned in the direction of the circuit, plunges into the South face to come out again through the North face (see fig. 12b).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-11_12.png]]

We have therefore just linked a mobility confined within a plane to a penetration aimed perpendicularly to this plane (see chapter IV). It is easy to see that, conversely, the datum of a body or a witness-helix (of a 'relic of orientation') makes it possible uniquely to link a rotation with a mark made on an axis or an oriented straight line. We find again here, for the angles, a situation that has already been analysed in chapter IV. Within these rules, it is the mobilities of the entire body (or those of an elementary robot like a corkscrew, capable of capturing and producing them) that are propelled: AmpÃ¨re's bonhomme must turn *himself* from *his* right to *his* left in order to follow the circuit with his gaze, the corkscrew *transforms a flick of the wrist into a penetration* or, what amounts to the same thing, a progressive spreading out into a height. 

Here again we see the acquisition of a dimension, which accompanies the dispelling of an ambiguity by an orientation marker. It is easy to see that in the absence of this last articulation of the circuits and axes would be equivocal: a circuit can be seen as 'positive' from one side and as 'negative' from the other (see fig. 13).

![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-13.png]]

But we have already seen (see chapter III) that in grazing the equivocal a new dimension can be born, even if a less trivial decision is solicited and a more ambitious articulation is involved.

AmpÃ¨re understands that it is necessary to bring about the birth of the difference between North and South poles by an *axis* and that a link exists between the undivided solidarity of these poles and the distinction between them which is arranged by a totally external convention. To dissolve these 'boreal' and 'austral' polarities, he decides to see them as the North and South faces of electrical circuits. This *axial* grasp of magnetism causes the two poles to emerge contemporaneously and electrogeometry takes over, exploring the beings or forces created by the dissymmetries of rotations.

> As long as the manner in which I conceive the action of the magnets is not accepted and these two kinds of forces are attributed to molecules of austral and boreal fluids, it is impossible to reduce them to a single principle: but as soon as my way of seeing the construction of the magnets is adopted, it is seen by the foregoing calculations that these two types of actions and the values of the forces that come from them are immediately deduced from my formula and that, to find these values, it is enough to substitute for the two-molecule assembly, one austral fluid molecule, the other of boreal fluid, a solenoid whose extremities, which are the two determinate points to which the forces in question belong, are placed at exactly the same points where the molecules of the two fluids are supposed to be.
> 
> ![[Figuring-Space_Fig-5-14.png]]
> 
> From now on, two systems of very small solenoids will act on one another, according to my formula, like two magnets composed of as many magnetic elements as one would suppose there to be solenoids in these two systems; one of these same systems will also act on the element of electric current, as a magnet does, and consequently all the calculations, all the explanations that are based as much on a consideration of the attractive and repulsive forces of these molecules in inverse proportion to the squares of distances as on those of revolutionary forces between one of these molecules and an element of electrical current, concerning which I have just recalled the law that is accepted by the physicists who do not adopt my theory, are necessarily the same, whether like me on explains the phenomena produced by the magnets in these two cases by electrical currents or whether one prefers the hypothesis of the two fluids.[^13]

We see how far the old convention differs from that of AmpÃ¨re's solenoids: the first is based on the persistence and the incrustation of certain entities (the North pole, the South pole), the second on the continuity of the propulsion of orientation (I can choose a contrary convention to interpret $NS$, but I have to stick to it). The axial convention and its pieces of evidence (AmpÃ¨re's bonhomme, corkscrew, etc.) liberate the full lateral intuition, henceforth free of the scars of magnetism and electrostatic images. This is why the axial polarization mobilizes different allusions from interaction at a distance. The latter required only the passive contemplation of a third party, who was kept apart form the play of the forces. Here, the 'third party' is much more active: he turns himself into a corkscrew, composed of a head with a right and a left arm, he propels an orientation and stands surety for the invariability of the sample of orientation.

The laterality experiment dissolves the old substrates: the North and South poles are but the scars of the old imagery: the solenoid and electrical loop liberate the forces sunk into the bars (the pieces of length). As Schelling had sensed, the grasping of electrical and magnetic forces in a single intuition does not consist in identifying boreal or austral 'natures' with positive or negative natures, but in understanding that everything revolves around a new involvement of space, around a new way of making choices of orientation reverberate. We rediscover the role of the indifference centre: to increase the toing and froing between nature and thought by propagating ambiguity in order to provoke a decision that involves a larger field. Here, the victory of the lateral over the longitudinal opens out a vast field into which the electrical and 'galvanic'[^14] metaphors on which electrogeometers will feed to forge their theories can rush.

## 4. The Axial as Subversion of the Transitive
We will now examine the stakes of the axial in greater detail and show how electrogeometry is part of the strategy of deliberate ambiguity made use of by Argand to extract *two* lateral units from *one* negative unit. We should remember that it was Hamilton who was first to demonstrate the connection between polar vectors and virtual (aims of objects) or actual (displacements from one place to another) grasps.[^15] In the introduction to the *Lectures on Quaternions*, he explains (to introduce what we would today call affine space):

> In this way, the symbol $B-A$ has come with us to denote the straight line from $A$ to $B$, the point $A$ being (at first) considered as a known thing, or a datum in some geometrical investigation, and the point $B$ being (by contrast) regarded as a sought thing, or a quaesitum; while $B-A$ is at first supposed to be a representation of the ordinal relation in space of the sought point $B$ to the given point $A$; [or] of the geometrical DIFFERENCE of those two points, that is to say, the difference of their two POSITIONS in space.[^16]

Hamilton then gives an example borrowed from astronomy, where $A$ is the Earth and $B$ the Sun observed from the Earth:

> Thus, in the astronomical example of earth and sun, the line $B-A$ has been sent to extend from the plane of observation $A$ (the earth), to the place of the observed body $B$ (the sun); and to serve to connect, at least in thought, the latter position with the former.
> 
> Again, you may have seen that with me the primary geometrical operation denoted by the mark $+$, and called by the name addition, or more fully, symbolical Addition, consists in a certain correspondent ordinal synthesis of the position of mathematical point in space. Instead of comparing such a position, $B$, with another position $A$, we now regard ourselves as deriving the one position from the other. The point $B$ had been before a *punctum analyzandum*; it is now a *punctum constructum*l. It was lately the subject of analysis; it is now the result of synthesis. It was a mark to be aimed at; it is now the end of a flight, or of a journey. It was a thing to be investigated (analytical) by our studying or examining its position; it is now a thing which has been produced by our operating (synthetically) on another point $A$, with the aid of a certain instrument, namely, the straight line $B-A$, regarded now as a vector, or carrying path, as is expressed by the employment of the sign of vection, $+$, through the general and identical formulas:
> $(B-A) +A = B$
> That other point, $A$, instead of being now a *punctum analyzans*, comes to be considered and spoken of as a *punctum vehendum*; ... while the point $B$, which had been analyzed, has come to be called a vectum, according to the general formula:
> $\text{Vector} + \text{Vehund} = \text{Vectum}$
> where Plus is (as above mentioned) the Sign of Vection, or the characteristic of ordinal synthesis. From serving, in the astronomical example, as a post of observation, the earth, $A$, comes to be thought of as the commencement of a transition, $B-A$, while thus beginning at the earth is conceived to terminate at the sun; and conversely, the sun, $B$, is thought of as occupying a situation in space, which is not now proposed to be studied by observation, but is rather conceived as one which has been reached, or arrived at, by a journey, transition, or transport of some moveable point or body from the earth, along the geocentric vector of the sun.[^17]

This long quotation from Hamilton clearly demonstrates the close link between polar vectors and transits. A polar vector always connects, zealously abolishes a gap between two polarities that have already been given as opposed; it always refers to the abolition of a 'confrontation': transport of charges, flowing out of liquids that strive to fill a difference in potential, a gap between pre-marked degrees. In the same way as force (see I,2), it presents itself without adornment as a sincere figure of the transitive, as a 'passage', as a forced immersion (still to be accomplished or already accomplished) in the successive, as a dotted or real trajectory. The polar vector zealously accounts for, by making it banal, that which is conveyed from a transmitter to a receiver, that which is communicated between markers, and, like all communication, it connects only to neutralize oppositions, to intercalate itself between the degrees of potentials or to join up two 'levels'.

Polar vectors and translations reduce the grasp of space to a displacement, to a running out along a direction, with no allusion to a width; they are content with merely transmitting to the geometer instructions concerning mobility which come from already conquered dimensions. With the axial, a genuine geometric humour finally bursts in with the budding of another dimension: height with the helix, thickness with the corkscrew. The axial vector does not claim to trace a transport, does not refer to any 'opposites' that it is constantly neutralizing. It exists only as an articulation of a rotation and translation which compels the geometer to orient himself within the whole space. It asserts as positive the non-canonical character of this articulation which results from the dispelling of an ambiguity and not from a logical deduction or the invitation to embrace a trajectory. The axial is innocent of any unwinding: it succeeds in contriving a density for the spatial.

A transport, a *vection act*, penetrates nothing: the gesture that directs it is immediately swallowed up in the length, whereas the axial unscrews another dimension by appropriating a trick practised in a perpendicular plane. The axial transfixes a face without displacing it, at the same time as causing sides to emerge: there is something cruel and perplexing  about the screwings and the unscrewings. The polar vector links degrees of potential, whereas the axial torments the spatial to extract degrees of penetration. Given a corkscrew, the axial unscrews the longitudinal to carry it off into the helicoidal. It therefore leads a successful, calculated subversion of the transitive by being able to see two rotations sketched in dotted lines in the axial vector and to opt for one of them by a process of orientation, just as Argand's balance could extract two lateral units and choose one of them to guide a rotation.

Extracting degrees of penetration by taking the 'square root' of a transport of a *vection act*: we are going to see that Faraday, Hamilton and Maxwell could all three have recognized themselves in this programmed. All three experimented with devices for coalescing degrees (see II,1) that no longer only unfold them along a trajectory by making the forces work, but that win them for a conquest of the density, substituting corkscrews for the trolleys and rulers of mass of mechanics (see fig. 15).

See also the interesting commentary on analogy and similitude on p. 54 (we should never forget that Hamilton was also a theologian and that it is analogical balances that grasp transcendences rationally).

[^52]: Jacques Lacan understood the subversive power of the knot, which is comparable both to algorithms and allusion. There is indeed a spatial imperium, which is conquered through a rearticulation of cursiveness, degrees of height and laterality.
[^53]: By setting up a kind of competition with 'pure' writing, they emphasize the rights of an initiatory kind of rationality, appreciable by a few rare connoisseurs careful not to succumb to the easy transitivities of the literal or to the fascination of images.
