# Appendix II: Note on Hamilton's Astronomical Example

Hamilton illustrates the multiplication table of the units $\textbf{i},\textbf{j},\textbf{k}$ thus: let there be the usual four cardinal points (see fig. A).

With them Hamilton associates two directions of aim (from the south towards the north, let this be $\alpha$, and from the west towards the east, let this be $\gamma$) which he complements with a direction $\beta$ (from the ground towards the zenith); $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ thus specifying three directions for the telescope (see fig. B).

These directions of aim can be understood as related to vectors (in the sense of the quotations on pg. 161).

Hamilton then chooses to represent the spatial units $\textbf{i},\textbf{j},\textbf{k}$ and to associate them with cardinal points, as figure C shows.

Adopting suitable lengths, the directions $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are linked to $\textbf{i},\textbf{j},\textbf{k}$ by the relations $\alpha = -\textbf{i}$, $\textbf{j} = -\gamma$, $\beta = \textbf{k}$. 

By suitable rotations of the telescope, the directions of aim can be changed for one another. These rotations are oriented by the axes $\textbf{i},\textbf{j},\textbf{k}$ and are brough about as follows:

(a) A first rotation $R(\textbf{j})$ turns the telescope around $\textbf{j}$ (see figs D and E), seen in a clockwise direction from $W$.

This gives the geometrical illustration of the multiplication by $\textbf{j}$ of perpendicular vectors. 

The telescope, which was pointing towards the north, now points towards the zenith $Z$, and we have:

$$\beta = R(\textbf{j})\alpha = R(\textbf{j})(-\textbf{i}) = \textbf{j} \times (-\textbf{i}) = \textbf{i} \times \textbf{j} = \textbf{k}$$

(b) Then, by carrying out a pivot $R(\textbf{i})$ (see fig. Eb) around $\textbf{i}$ (the motion being effected in a clockwise direction if it is seen from the south), the telescope points towards the east (extremity of $\gamma$). We have therefore:

$$-\textbf{j} = \gamma = R(\textbf{i})(\beta) = \textbf{i} \times \textbf{k} \  \ \textit{or}\ \ \textbf{k} \times \textbf{i} = -\textbf{i} \times \textbf{k} = \textbf{j} $$

This is the position of Hamilton's figure Ec.

(c) It is possible to then point the telescope towards the south, by bringing about a rotation $R(\textbf{k})$ of the axis $\textbf{k}$ (see fig. F).

![[Figuring-Space_FigF.png]]

We have $R(\textbf{k}) = -\alpha$. Let it also be that: $\textbf{k} \times -\textbf{j} = +\textbf{i}$ or $\textbf{i} = \textbf{j} \times \textbf{k}$. 

This sequence of three pivots &mdash; $R(\textbf{j})$, then $R(\textbf{i})$, then $R(\textbf{k})$ &mdash; has therefore brought the telescope in a direction (from the north towards the south) that is opposite to its initial direction of aim (from the south towards the north). It illustrates the relation $\textbf{k}\textbf{i}\textbf{j} = -\textbf{1}$. 

Hamilton takes care to distinguish the *directions of aim* designated by the Greek letters $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and the *unit-axes* designated by the Latin letters $(\textbf{i},\textbf{j},\textbf{k})$. The latter induce rotations. Thus the use of the terms *versum* for a direction of aim and *versor* for a spatial unit becomes clear: 'availing myself' (as you see) of the distinction between the roman and the italic alphabets, to mark, at least temporarily, the distinction between the two different conceptions of a line, as a *turned* and as a *turning* thing; a *versum* and a *versor*; a subject of operation and an operator' (*Lectures on Quaternions*, II, pp. 61-62). 

The *versors* articulate the *versums* between them, which justifies the reference (p. 172) to an 'articulated trihedron'. It will be observed that Hamilton's trihedron, constructed with cardinal points, is the opposite of the 'direct' trihedron of modern geometers (see figs. Ga and Gb).

There are in fact two ways of embodying in space the order prescribed by the successive enunciation of $\textbf{i}$, then $\textbf{j}$, then $\textbf{k}$. They each induce different conventions in order to give form to the multiplication table.
