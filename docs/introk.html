<blockquote>
<p>A diagram can transfix a gesture, bring it to rest, long before it
curls up into a sign, which is why modern geometers and cosmologers like
diagrams with their peremptory power of evocation. They capture gestures
mid-flight; for those capable of attention, they are the moments where
being is glimpsed smiling. Diagrams are in a degree the accomplices of
poetic metaphor. But they are a little less impertinent — it is always
possible to seek solace in the mundane plotting of their thick lines —
and more faithful: they can prolong themselves into an operation which
keeps them from becoming worn out. Like the metaphor, they leap out in
order to create spaces and reduce gaps: they blossom with dotted lines
in order to engulf images that were previously figured in thick lines.
But unlike the metaphor the diagram is not exhausted. (10)<a href="#fn1"

</blockquote>
<p>By bringing into critical range the diagrammatic writing that shadows
science, Châtelet’s splendid book <em>Figuring Space</em> provides an
intellectual space for a far more articulate anthropology of scientific
discovery. In fact, it is quite accurate to view the books as marking
the formulation of a critical practice that could be called
<em>diagrammatology</em>, a practice that would bring into range the
phenomenological analysis of diagrams and diagrammatic practice in
science. Châtelet not only poses questions about figures and writing
technologies and how we think about space with them, through them, and
in them, but offers strategies for assuring that subsequent discussion
does not become isolated in one discipline. In contrast to discussions
that approach the practice of science from the vantage-point of natural
language, Châtelet shows how we encompass our scientific practice in the
inventive spaces provided by diagrammatic writing. Although Châtelet
tells us that he has written his book as a philosophical dialogue, it is
neither an orchestrated classical discourse nor a staged philosophical
conversation. We might instead approach Châtelet’s discussion of
physics, mathematics, and philosophy as a discourse reminiscent of the
seductive strategies for thinking about optical mathematics and physics
in provocative French texts such as the <em>Roman de la Rose.</em><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Such comparisons are not as strange
as they initially appear when one recalls that Jean de Meun, the author
of the second part of the medieval work, taught optical physics at the
University of Paris. I want to emphasize such an unexpected comparison
because it anticipates the deliberate manner in which Châtelet deploys
unexpected metaphors within a mathematical field. The comparison is
useful because it reminds us that the book should not be adopted
automatically into one genre or another but applies to a broad audience.
In what follows, I want to look at the extended audiences for the book,
the sequence of case histories that make up the book, and several of the
implications inherent in Châtelet’s discussion of diagrams and
metaphors.</p>
<h2 id="part-one-settings">Part One: Settings</h2>
<p>Châtelet’s project must be situated from the outset within an ongoing
discussions about the conceptual or cognitive formation of space pursued
by various disciplines. Although it is impossible to register all the
names here, the terrain is marked by a range of well-recognized works
devoted to thinking about the configuration of space: in art history and
aesthetics (Arnheim, Gombrich, Stafford), in graphic and computer
interface-design (Tufte, Turkle, Coyne, Bolter), cultural studies
(Mitchell, Foster, Haraway), language and metaphor (Ricoeur, Barthes,
Lakoff and Johnson), history of science (Galison, Daston, Lenoir).<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Given the wealth of such
discussions, the absence of a broad study of the ways mathematical space
has been configured is striking. At least initially this may be
explained by an awareness of the ways in which mathematics continues to
stand as a bastion of internalist theories of science or as the domain
of logic par excellence. Châtelet’s book is remarkable exactly for the
ways it would have readers recognize the contortions embodied in a
history of mathematics written from the vantage-point of theorems rather
than from a combination of theory, practice and application. In effect,
for Châtelet our relationship to mathematics has been explained only
halfway. To active our understanding of intuition, invention and
discovery in mathematics we need to become cognisant that the space of
mathematics has been mediated not only through theorems but also through
diagrams.</p>
<p>I am pleased to introduce the translation of Châtelet’s book because
it marks a significant moment in the reexamination of the practice of
mathematics.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> On the broadest level, the book
conveys multiple arguments against the prevalence of of disciplinary
identity that would isolate, mythologize, or blackbox mathematics. When
approached through sweeping historical surveys or embedded assumptions
that mathematics should be equated with logic or that mathematics is
“pinned” to nature, mathematics as practiced becomes distorted. For
Châtelet, there is far more to do than honour a theorem-driven history
of mathematics or interpret mathematics from the vantage-point of
philosophy. What Châtelet proposes is a project for looking at the ways
mathematics has explored geometric space. Instead of proving theoresm,
Châtelet argues that our investigation of mathematics must include our
manual technologies for representing space — marking, drawing,
sketching, scribbling. For Châtelet our own interaction with the figures
that we draw constitutes a place of invention and discovery that cannot
be explained away by the theorems that appear to lock down a particular
mathematical procedure. ‘There remains, however, a desire to take up
again in the flesh that which is perceived as a whole that has been
mutilated by technical dispersement, a genuine nostalgia for magical
power, exasperated by the incapacity of classical rationalism to get to
grips with all these sleights of hand, all these ’recipes’, all these
thought experiments, these figures and diagrams, all these dynasties of
problems seemingly capable of the ‘miracle’ of reactivation.’ (3)</p>
<p>It is precisely the reactivation of problems that Châtelet underatkes
in the book. Rather than great names, it is a matter of strategies. ‘The
great names of Galois, Faraday, Maxwell, or Heisenberg reverberate — but
substances, established categories, structures, objects and forms do
not. That is why I will devote myself here, with the aid of some
xamples, to demonstrating the historical dignity of problems, their
dynastic exemplariness that has never been exhausted by acknowledgement
or hypothesis of ’influences.’ <em>Gestures and problems mark an epoch
and, unknown to geometers and philosophers, guide the eye and
hand.</em>’ [My emphasis] (3). Châtelet’s observation is important not
for abstraction but for specificity. What Châtelet emphasizes is the
importance of looking at the manual technology used to formulate space.
Rulers, straight edges, compasses, protractors, right angles, coordinate
systems, etc. — each has been taken so for granted that we fail to see
the way they have controlled our spatial interactions. ‘These diagrams
take their place in a line of descent that runs from Avicenna to Leibniz
and therefore prepare for what Heidegger calls modern science’s project
of the mathematical questioning of Nature. It is no exaggeration to
speak of the historical resonance of these diagrams, which abolish the
rigid division between algebra, which clarified the determination
operations of variables, and geometry, whose figures ensured the
protection of the contemplative.’ (11) In contrast to the metaphors
which becomes fixed as it were in the sedimenta of language, diagrams
may be reactivated. ‘The diagram never goes out of fashion: it is a
project that aims to apply exclusively to what it sketches; this demand
for autonomy makes it the natural accomplice of thought experiments.’
(11)</p>
<p>It is not the paradigm shifts but the continuity of problems that
concerns Châtelet. ‘Thus, two very different rhythms underpin the
’history of ideas’; the first is intermittent and consists of
‘ruptures’, of paradigms and their refutations; the second is quieter
but is still open to reactivation, and consists of a rumination, a
motionless worrying of the problematic cores.’ (7) ‘That is why two
different rhythms underpin the ’history of ideas’: the one, completely
discontinuous, of ‘ruptures’, ‘paradigms’ and their refutations, and the
other of the problematic latencies that are always available for
reactivation and full of treasures for those who can reawaken them.’
(69-70) For Châtelet the double progression of truth in science involves
not only a definition of truth but an ongoing progression of
technologies that has been ignored within the study of mathematics. ‘It
has long been the case in mathematics, and Euclid himself provided the
model, that of the two series of developments it is normal to value only
the one that forms the content proper, while the trouble of finding the
other between the lines is left to the reader. Only, although
arrangement and presentation of this series of developments are
complete, it is nonetheless impossible to make the overview visible at
each stage of the latter to whoever should first of all know science,
and to put it in a state where it can progress freely and of itself. To
do this, it is rather necessary for the reader to be put in the state in
which the discoverer of truth ought to be in the most favorable case.’
(Grassman quoted by Châtelet, 104).</p>
<p>What Châtelet envisions is a genealogy of diagrams that begins to map
the way that mathematics has worked through writing. In effect, what
Châtelet brings before his reader is a study that would distinguish
between the historical events of mathematics and the technologies that
accompany them. Just as the study of language or history may be divided
into various synchronic and diachronic components, so mathematics may be
looked to not only for ‘correct answers’ but for strategies of cognitive
intuition. Mathematics is historicized at the same time that it is
recognized to contain patterns of thought. Châtelet opens a new science
not of tropes or figures in the sense of Vico but for a new survey of
mathematical topoi and the way that they provoke thought. Such a project
has various generations. Certainly one ground is provided by a
neo-Kantian epistemology (Cassirer), another by the efforts of
phenomenology to describe mathematical operations (Husserl, Ponty,
Bachelard, Heidegger, and Derrida), and another by the pragmatic
semiotics of Peirce. Such ground, in part recognized by Châtelet’s
bibliography, allows us to recognize philosophers of science who share a
similar spirit of inquiry such as Michel Serres, Gilles Deleuze, and
Brian Rotman<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Even more recently it would not be
misleading to recognize the linkages between Châtelet and the recent
publication of discussion between Changeux and Connes.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> A
further setting for the work is provided by visualization within our
evolving electronic environments which I will return to below<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. Although it may initially appear a
misstep to compare Châtelet with Derrida, I think the comparison not
only appropriate but instructive. A major feature of Derrida’s work,
usually lost within the world of Anglo-American theory, is Derrida’s
ongoing conversation with mathematics which is in part a consequence of
his own education and best represented through his work on his
commentary on Husserl’s <em>Origins of Geometry</em>.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> But
while Derrida’s project has involved language and the multiple
strategies that have been used to encompass language, Châtelet’s project
involves the ways entailment has worked in the description of geometric
space.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Both are drawn to moments in which
the use of language or mathematics becomes self-referential. Both are
interested in graphology or the technologies we create not only to
remember but to think. For Châtelet, in particular, diagrams work as
prosthetic devices that become vehicles of intuition and thought.
Châtelet’s book challenges us to think of a <em>diagrammatology</em>
precisely in such settings.</p>
<h2
id="part-two-reactivating-problems-case-histories-from-mathematics">Part
Two: Reactivating Problems: Case Histories from Mathematics</h2>
<p>Far from being encased displays in a museum-like history of science,
Châtelet’s case histories function like apertures or nodes within an
ongoing exploration of abstract space. Although the chapters interact
with each other within an historical continuum, reading them out of
order would show not only the theoretical linkages at work throughout
the book but would provoke the reader to make further discoveries about
diagrams.</p>
<p>When placed side by side the chapters describe evolving strategies
for addressing the extension of space and the diagrammatic technologies
that render such extension possible. Let us look briefly at the terrain
Châtelet explores in five chapters devoted to virtuality, geometric
perspective, negative numbers, the dialectic between real and imagined
space, and the electromagnetic space. In the first chapter, Châtelet
shows that Aristotle’s conception of matter (hyle) bears with it an idea
of virtuality that makes it impossible to fix nature within a geometric
grid. it is precisely such virtuality which provides Leibniz with a
means of thinking of matter as living. ‘Leibniz is certainly among those
who have most profitably pondered Aristotle’s discreet invitation; he
was able to see in virtuality a means of combining act and power that
was suited to answering the questions that were preoccupying him.’ (20)
It is not, however, the virtuality or potentially of nature which
interests Châtelet but the impossibility of affirming an absolute
correspondence between matter and mathematics. Instead of a one to one
correspondence between mathematics and nature which would render
mathematics as mechanical, Châtelet emphasizes the drama that takes
place between matter and the languages used to describe it. ‘Leibniz saw
that the complete staging of mathematical physics involved the
construction of imposing infrastructures which could not help but
implicate metaphysics.’ (22)</p>
<p>In the second chapter, Châtelet looks at how ideas of ‘horizon’
function within the discourse of mathematics and physics. What Châtelet
would have his reader see is the way the invention of geometric
perspective becomes a vehicle for staging space. What is so intriguing
about Châtelet’s discussions is the way in which he can move from a
discussion of horizons in fifteenth-century perspective drawing to
evolving ideas of the spectrum and the horizons created by the movement
of a pendulum. Each action or representation described by Châtelet is
crucial because it creates an expectation of an ever changing horizon.
For Châtelet it is the gestures or diagrams that register matter which
are important not because they fix an understanding but because they
become stages for an intuition of how the horizon may be altered. The
extraordinary passage from Leibniz’s <em>Metaphysics</em> which provoked
so much commentary by Deleuze, attracts Châtelet as well. ‘We have to
postulate that there is a screen in this dark room to receive the
species, and that it is not uniform but is diversified by folds
representing items of innate knowledge; and, what is more, that this
screen or membrane, being under tension, has a kind of elasticity to
active force … This action would consist in certain vibrations or
scintillations, like those we see when a cord under tension is plucked.’
It is not the convoluted or even mystical representation of space which
attracts Châtelet but the playful way in which Leibniz draws out or
intimates the potentiality of geometric space. Rather than offer a
prosaic explication of Leibniz, Châtelet remodels or echoes Leibniz
through his own description of space.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
‘These were a reminder that the degrees of removal from a painting
cannot be glided over like the degrees of a thermometer but compel the
eye to accept the patience of the oblique; one must saturate oneself
with the degrees of removal without ever letting oneself be trapped by
verticality or horizontality alone, and everything that can be
contemplated by a simple raising of the look or by a later inspection
only wrecks the depth.’ (50) ‘Whether it is a question of a landscape or
of a domain of knowledge, the obliquity given out by the horizon imposes
a fragile but implacable norm, which by setting right the figures
finitude (iterations, transits, logical chains …) establishes a precious
hinge between the sparkle of the ’metaphorical’ and the already
domesticated rational’ (53) ‘The horizon makes it possible to venture
into the turbulent space where science, art and philosophy brush against
one another without merging’ (53). ‘The horizon is neither a boundary
marker that prohibits or solicits transgression, nor a barrier drawn in
a dotted line across the sky. Once it has been decided, one always
carries one’s horizon away with one. this is the exasperating side of
the horizon: corrosive like the visible, tenacious like a smell,
compromising like touch, it does not dress things up with appearances,
but impregnates everything that we are resolved to grasp.’ (54) We might
say that it is not the potentiality of the stone which stands before the
sculpture that interests Châtelet but the potentiality of the space
surrounding the stone and the sculpture.</p>
<p>In the third chapter, Châtelet moves from optical strategies for
envisioning and extending geometric space to the imaginary landscapes
provoked by the discovery of negative numbers. ‘The geometric intuition
is therefore no longer only the kind of ocular inspection which
ascertained the agreement to mathematical calculations with measurements
of real objects: it is henceforth more the possibility of grasping by
<em>diagram</em> the exposition of the conquest of space, consecrating
thus the emergence of a <em>physico-geometric continuum</em> in two
dimensions …’ (79) The discussion not only invites the reader into less
known work by Kant on imaginary numbers but shows how the utility of
negative numbers can be linked to the visual representation of
electromagneticism in the nineteenth century. ‘Historians of sciences
have probably not given thought to this surprising fact: the
identification of imaginary numbers with the plane appears in the
mathematical literature only at the beginning of the nineteenth
century.’ (78-79) As throughout the book, Châtelet’s interest is not in
the development of theorems or in pointing to the peaks of some mountain
chain in the history of mathematics, but rather in the way that
imaginary numbers provoke new ways of envisioning matter. As I will
suggest below, Châtelet may be thought of as identifying spacial topoi
within mathematics just as one is able to identify topoi within the
study of literature. From some vantage point, Châtelet may be thought of
opening a tropology of mathematics.</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter, Châtelet moves to the mathematical strategies
for spreading and stretching dimensionality. The discussion shows how
ideas of multidimensional space emerge through the extension of an idea
of entailment. In effect, the conception of one set of spacial
parameters provokes a process by which those parameters can become
entailed by another parameter. Châtelet finds ground for his analysis in
Grassmann’s Theory of the Extension (1844). Grassmann provides an entry
point into twentieth-century physics through the ways in which he
intuits the relationships between visible and invisible space. In
Châtelet’s words space thus appears as a visible understanding, and the
understanding as an invisible space.’ (103) What Châtelet finds most
intriguing about Grassmann, however, is the way that he ‘represents a
genuine pedagogy of the forms of the grasping of space.’ (103) Essential
to this pedagogy is the reader’s capacity for an overview. ‘This
’overview is not the dilettante’s distant contemplation; it takes part
in the action: it is an <em>intellectual intuition</em>, in the sense
intended in the philosophy of nature. it transports us to that
privileged zone where intuition and discursivity become knotted into a
living unity. It is neither a priori nor a posteriori; it is
contemporaneous with what it grasps.’ (104) In Grassmann’s own words:
“Presentiment [<em>Ahnung</em>] appears foreign to the domain of pure
science, above all to the domain of mathematics. However, without it, it
is impossible to find any new idea … It is — if conceived in the right
way — the look that seizes in one go any development that leads to the
new truth, but comprising instants that have not yet become exposed. It
is for this reason that the presentiment can at the beginning only be
obscure [<em>dunkles Vorgeful</em>].” (104) ‘That is why scientific
presentation is essentially a progression of <em>two</em>’ series of
developments, one of which leads in consequence <em>from one truth to
the next</em> and forms the <em>content</em> proper, while the other
<em>controls the process</em> itself and determines the <em>form</em> …’
(105)</p>
<p>In the fifth chapter, Châtelet shows how the discovery of
electrogeometric space in nineteenth-century physics opens strategies
for twentieth-century physics. But the chapter resonates with the
previous discussion in pressing well beyond a narrative that would
simply ‘show’ connections between ideas of space. It is precisely the
intervening diagrams which ‘show’ space, or to be more precise, space is
revealed by the experimental space of electrogeometric diagrams.
‘<em>[O]ne might speak of a preparation of space of experimentation
analogous to that of the moved awakened to mobility.</em>’ [My emphasis]
(163) In a discussion that at times takes up issues similar to those
treated by Brian Rotman, Châtelet notices that the orientation provided
by an idea of ‘0’ continues to change. Just as different conceptions of
‘0’ distinguish Euclid and the new terrain of imaginary numbers, so a
different idea of ‘0’ operates in electrogeometric space. As Châtelet
shows there is a sense in which it is the diagram itself replaces an
idea of ‘0’ as a point of orientation. ‘Electrical positivity is not
that of accumulation, but that of current that loops the (sic) around
opened by separation. The era of the circuits has begun and it will come
as no surprise if this device crystallizes a new type of intuition
linked with the domination of oppositions by loops and bends.’ (154) The
mediating linkage is not ‘0’ but the space itself. (165) ‘[C]urrent must
appropriate a new spatial dimension.’ (165) For example, Hamilton’s
quaternions offer not only a new mathematical method, but ‘a method of
thinking, and not, at least, for the present generation, a method for
saving thought.’ (Maxwell as quoted by Châtelet, 174) Maxwell ‘forges
<em>a scientific praxis of analogy and the introduction of
similarity.</em>’ (180) ‘The figure of speech or of thought by which we
transfer the language and ideas of a familiar science to one with which
we are less acquainted may be called Scientific Metaphor.’ (Maxwell as
quoted by Châtelet, 181)</p>
<h2 id="part-three-diagrams-and-metaphors">Part Three: Diagrams and
Metaphors</h2>
<p>Just as a rich terrain is negotiated between the different valences
of the word plot in English, revealing valences surround the word
diagram or <em>διάγραμμα</em> in Greek. The root verb of
<em>διαγραμμα</em>, <em>διαγραφον</em> not simply something which is
marked out by lines, a figure, form, or plan but also carries a
secondary connotation of marking or crossing out. This meaning is
specifically present in the word <em>διαγραφω</em>. (In contemporary
Greek the verb <em>διαγραφον</em> means to write someone off). The
connection between drawing figures and crossing something out is more
than a philological curiosity because it suggests a word that was used
in Greek to refer to writing on a wax note pad in which the mark of a
stylus would simultaneously cross over the marks that had been drawn
previously. <em>Διαγραμμα</em> in effect embodies a practice of figuring
and defiguring. What is interesting here is that diagram participates in
a genealogy of figures that moves from the wax tablet to the computer
screen. From a phenomenological vantage point, the Greek meaning of
diagram indicates that any figure that is drawn is accompanied by an
expectancy that it will be redrawn. From the vantage point of the Greek
root, diagram presents a reminder of how frequently technologies of
representation are ignored within the history of mathematics. The status
of the diagram is at least in part a consequence of technologies of
representation whether in scrolls, codices, printed books, mimeographed
or xeroxed sheets, or hand-held calculators or desktop monitors. Is
there not a relation between Cusa and problems with manuscript
presentation on the eve of Gutenberg? Is there not a relationship
between Poincare’s work and color-lithography or Descartes and new
engraving technologies? These are questions that we are only now
beginning to ask.</p>
<p>Diagrams hardly stand as isolated figures but are placed within a
narrative setting. They become — or are intended to become — part of a
structured argument. If we want we may think of mathematics as a process
of building modalities that entail the representation of space
(diagrams). Just as it is possible to define a taxonomic structure for
genre of story problems, it is possible to identify diagrammatical
categories. Although I cannot go into detail here, I want to notice that
a broad distinction can be made between ephemeral and professional
applications. Doodling on a napkin, or the idiosyncratic systems of a
Feynman are in a category separate from the diagrams of textbook
traditions. Even here, however, it is not possible to make a rigorous
distinction. And indeed it would appear that rigorous distinctions will
be increasingly difficult to make as we follow diagrams into the
experimental space of the monitor. I want to make an additional
observation as well. The distinction made between diagrams in textbooks
and in doodling is one that has continued to be reinforced by a history
of mathematics that continues to emphasize theorems and their display in
textbooks. Whether ones looks at Tartaglia, Galileo, Newton, or Leibniz,
ephemeral manuscript diagrams (napkin doodling) is placed in the realm
of biography rather than realm of mathematics. This is a mistake I think
because it removes the site of invention from mathematical
discourse.</p>
<p>Lest we begin to think that the questions we are asking about
diagrams are somehow unique within the practice of mathematics, Châtelet
reminds us we are actually part of an important discussion that has
accompanied mathematics for a long time. It is, however, a discussion
that has been exported into the footnotes or marginalia of philosophy.
Plato’s use of a diagram to teach the Pythagorean theorem to an ignorant
servant, Nicholas of Cusa’s metaphor experiments, the explosion of
diagrammatic matter diffused through the diffusion of printing
technologies — provides evidence of efforts to speak about
diagrammatics. In several cases we have evidence of diagrammatics as
central in epistemology and the philosophy of education. Leibniz, for
example, becomes increasingly attracted to understanding the interaction
between different symbol systems<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> At the end of the
nineteenth century, Charles Sanders Peirce writes a critical report on
the status of math education in the United States in which the
relationship between narrative and diagram becomes a focal point.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In his preface to the first edition of the <em>Principia</em> (1687),
Newton observes that geometry is ‘founded in mechanical practice.’<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Even though he literally means that
geometry relies on the manual arts, Newton’s own discussion shows that
he ultimately believes that such mechanical ability depends on one’s
capacity to comprehend natural law In other words one’s mechanical
ability to draw, is shaped by one’s capacity to translate God’s graphic
presence in nature. In effect, the Newtonian mechanic takes inspired
dictation. Newton’s argument is all the more remarkable given the
extraordinary degree to which he is obsessed by the graphic
representation of his own thought.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I want to emphasize
the case of Newton because it illustrates the avoidance that philosophy
and the history of mathematics have shown the mediating presence of
writing technology. Châtelet would have us see how diagrams, far from
being simply a register of a mechanical process, work as a means for
mathematical discovery. What Newton ascribes to metaphysis — and what
has become factor in the mystification of mathematics — is rather a
manifestation of his interaction with the shapes, marks, scribblings,
sketches on the paper before us. What often is taken for granted — what
was regarded as ‘scratch paper’ becomes a significant means for
mathematical exploration. It is revealing that even at the same time
Newton assumes a transcendent authority and even authorization of his
work, his own manuscript work is filled with masses of scratch paper.
Indeed, from the vantage point of seventeenth-century mathematics,
Leibniz’s own fully conscious and active interest in the importance of
the graphic media used to think marks an important difference between
his work and Newton.</p>
<p>Before commenting on the use of metaphor in the book, I want to
review several functions Châtelet ascribes to diagrams. Although the
book will surely provoke the reader to identify additional diagrammatic
operations, it may be helpful to notice six major features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Diagrams constitute technologies tha tmediate between other
technologies of writing.</em> The physicality of the diagram is also an
extension of the literal technologies used in their construction. ‘Hence
I have thereby as it were propelled a hand by thought and one might be
tempted to say that the pincers or compasses give a <em>point of
view</em> to the hand, by associating an angle in which the interval is
’seen’ with the grasp.’ (151) ‘We get the full measure of what
distinguishes the ruler from the compasses and the angle. The ruler
implies an end-ot-end placement of standard measuring units, a
manipulation of a piece of direction. The ruler is a transfer that has
been frozen &amp;mdash ;a bar.’ (151-152) As we will see below, the
physicality associated with diagrams is also associated with
metaphor.</li>
<li><em>Diagrams create space for mathematical intuition.</em> ‘We could
describe this as a technique of allusions’ (10) and ‘A philosophy of the
physico-mathematical cannot ignore this symbolic practice which is prior
to formalism, this practice of condensation and amplification of the
intuition.’ (11)</li>
<li><em>Diagrams are not static but project virtuality onto the space
which they seek to represent.</em> ‘Faraday turns physics on its head by
deciding no longer to see them (lines of force) as subsidiary figures,
but as <em>incitements to provoke space</em>, as diagrams, as
<em>dotted-line</em> experiments alluding to ’real’ experiments that
manifest latent actions.’ (166) ‘Lines of force are neither ’real or
’artificial’; they do not mathematize forces; they do not pin
geometrical onto physical, rather they substitute an idea, but elastic
and tough, network, which allows virtuality to reclaim its rights.’
(166)</li>
<li><em>Diagrams represent a visual strategy for entailment.</em> [’The
horizon is neither] a boundary marker that prohibits or solicits
transgression, nor a barrier drawn in a dotted line across the sky. Once
it has been decided, one always carries one’s horizon away with one.
This is the exasperating side of the horizon: corrosive like the
visible, tenacious like a smell, compromising like touch, it does not
dress things up with appearances, but impregnates everything that we are
resolve to grasp.’ (54)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To grasp a dimension is to invent a diagram where the pure dispersion
of what Hegel called <em>aussereinandersein</em> (the ‘being outside one
another’) and the exuberance of the intensive balance one another out:
the unfolding of the latter nourishes the mobilization and straightening
of the former, and vice versa.’ (113)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Diagrams are mediating vehicles which means that they cannot
only be recovered bur rediscovered</em>. While they mediate between
other technologies of writing, they may also mediate or reveal links
between problems. ‘Nothing is more fertile, all mathematicians know,
than these obscure analogies, these murky reflections of one theory in
another, these furtive caresses, these inexplicable tiffs; also nothing
gives as much pleasure to the researcher. A day comes when the illusion
vanishes: presentiment turns into certainty … Luckily for researches, as
the fogs clear at one point, they form again at another.’ (Andre Weil as
quoted by Châtelet, 7).</li>
<li><em>Diagrams have a pedagogical force that could be integrated into
mathematical education.</em> ‘Faraday’s lines of force succeed in
appropriating what we are proposing to call diagrammatic experiments and
in giving a status of this language of ’speaking with the hands’, of the
‘physical sense’ whose driving power was sensed by the greatest
electrogeometers and which can grasp the instant when the metaphor
solidifies, when the operation contends with it for sovereignty. This
language feeds on gestures much more than on already available
mathematical forms and possesses a particular allusive power, which can
traverse the deductive chains of mathematical physics and illuminate
whole sections of geometry. The field has an intrinsic experimental
mission that protects it from the pretensions of the understanding (in
this sense it is irreducible to a transcendental grasp) and from the
appetites of causalities. There is, in the literal sense, no
‘application’ of the lines of fields, but rather an astonishing pedagogy
by allusions which straight away introduces an elastic space and place
with its capacity to resonate.’ (167)</li>
</ul>
<p>Châtelet’s presentation of diagrams becomes intimately associated
with his discussion and use of metaphor. Metaphors are deployed
throughout the book in ways that purposely cuts against the common
propensity to exile metaphor from mathematical discourse. At times
Châtelet’s sentences show him investigating mathematical space as a body
which holds its history in the way that it has been marked by scars or
signs of mutilation. Such wounds even require that addition of new forms
of abstraction which Châtelet refers to as prostheses. The cluster of
images indicate that geometric space has not simply been personified or
animated through metaphor but is fundamentally conceived as a living
entity. For example, ‘Faraday was the first to see electrogeometric
space <em>throb</em>.’ (166) Other times mathematics is portrayed as a
collection of rituals that have become empty gestures. The metaphor
suggests that Châtelet’s project may be rightfully approached as an
anthropology of mathematics. Châtelet’s metaphors hardly marks some
bizarre incursion of linguistic promiscuity into a domain of imageless
logic but are supported by the metaphors that have consciously been
employed within mathematical practice. For example, when Ampère
‘substitutes ’a conductor folded into a helix’ for the magnetized bar,
<em>the diagram of the solenoid is born</em> (155). Ampère himself
describes his idea as ‘an assembly to which I have given the name
electrodynamic solenoid, from the Greek word <em>solenoeides</em>, whose
meaning expresses precisely that which is shaped like a channel, that is
to say the surface of the form on which all the circuits are to be
found.’ (155)</p>
<p>Châtelet’s discussion and use of metaphor shows that he thinks of
metaphor as a form of technology and perhaps even more precisely as a
kind of conceptual scaffolding. ‘we should speak of <em>a technology of
the metaphor</em> that possesses an autonomous logic and precedes
formalization.’ (177) Châtelet’s observations have relevance not only
for broad discussions of metaphor and science, but should be related to
numerous insights provided from famous case histories in the history of
science. For example, Châtelet’s insights give further meaning to
observations made by Cassirer in his work on the metaphor experiments of
Nicholas of Cusa.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> They also provide a means for
approaching Latour’s explication of Einstein’s presentation of the
Theory of Special Relativity.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Above all, metaphor is
a vehicle for thinking and on certain occasions for altering the way one
thinks. Rather than being simply collected and controlled as topoi,
metaphor provides a means for intuiting a still evolving idea. ‘we must
therefore discovery some method of investigation which allows the mind
at every step to lay hold of a clear physical conception, without being
committed to any theory founded on the physical science from which that
conception is borrowed, so ’that it is neither drawn aside from the
subject in pursuit of analytical subtleties, nor carried beyond the
truth by a favorite hypothesis.’ (Maxwell as quoted by Châtelet,
181)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I want to recognize the multiple ways that Châtelet’s
book complements the intensified work on visualization that accompanies
our cultural adaptation of multiple screen technologies. In regard to
mathematics, much discussion has concerned the pedagogical
implementation of programs such as Mathematical and even more the
multiple impulses for exploring space found in the study of non-linear
mathematics. Without computer technology, geometry would have remained
imagined or invisible. The rediscovery of mathematics as an experimental
science is an important implication of these evolving technologies. But
as Châtelet shows the experimental nature of mathematics should hardly
be thought of as confined to electronic environments. Châtelet’s book is
important because it demonstrates how the experimental nature of
mathematics can be recovered from diagrams registered in the history of
mathematics. Finally, however, it is not single diagrams that Châtelet
would have us see but the register they provide for asking how we
discover geometric space and how such space in turn becomes used as
space for thinking. It is here that Châtelet’s project involves not
simply diagrams but diagrammatics as the study of diagrams within our
evolving cognitive histories. As Châtelet amply demonstrates, such study
ultimately cannot be restricted to a single discipline or domain. ‘There
is an urgent need for philosophy to penetrate further into the straits
where the futures tracing contemplation and the formulae actualizing
operations of determination are articulated. But these represent a
strategic space already haunted by two other combatants on the
battlefront of the obscure: art and science. Here, metaphor begins the
process of shedding its skin that will metamorphose it into operation,
and here it is that this nook swarms with clichés that strive to invite
us to view a rediscovered operativity.’ (8-9) It is Châtelet’s
accomplishment not only to have written a book rich with insights about
geometric space but to have ‘rediscovered operativity’ and in so doing
to have defined a critical movement from diagrams to diagrammatics.</p>

<li id="fn7"><p>In my own work, I have asked how natural language
shadows symbolic languages and how one language appears to entail
another or receive special authorization as a primary vehicle for
meaning. I have worked on case histories from early modern mathematics
and contemporary chaos theory because both provided a means for looking
at the intimate ways mathematical is associated with graphic
representation. Recently, I have worked on Newton’s interaction with his
own writing. It is precisely in an idea of employment understood as
process of projective mapping or drawing where my work resonates most
with Chatelet’s focus on mathematical diagrams. At present, I am looking
at the place of diagrams within the exploration of cognitive space
especially in our new screen technologies. See Kenneth J. Knoespel,
