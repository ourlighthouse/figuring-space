Liberation of the Gesture and the Bias of the Visible</h1>
<p>Jean-Toussaint Desanti</p>
<p>To see what one loves live: that is perhaps what happiness is.
Whoever loves mathematics will experience some happiness in reading
Gilles Châtelet’s book; and whoever does not may discover a reason to
love them in the particular way they have of assuming attitudes and
motion. Yet it will be necessary to learn to think backwards, ‘against
the grain’, to smash the multiple immobile shells in which the
‘mathematical thing’ is delivered, solid and congealed. Delivered like a
regulated object of learning, solid like an architecture of concepts,
congealed like a system of subsistent entities. In short, a product
packaged and labelled, ready for consumption.</p>
<p>Stop consuming for a while; suspend the ordinary power of the rules,
lay the cards of this game out on the table. Here they are henceforth
‘outside the game’, they have now passed into a free state and are yet
still visible, these ‘cards’ that we have learned to define and name:
‘points’, ‘sets of points’, ‘ordinary sets’, ‘systems of numbers’,
‘spaces’, etc. Free, but by no means inert. Outside the game with its
predetermined rules, they demand to be taken as stakes and offer
themselves up to the rules that they themselves arouse, without ever
submitting to any extremity of violence. If there is violence, its seed
is in them alone.</p>
<p>At root it seems to me that this is what Gilles Châtelet’s demand
consists of: break up the ready-made games; to surprise the rising up of
the thing itself that these games have been concerned with but which
they have ended up masking in their well-ordered and very satisfying
accumulation. The ‘thing itself’. This expression needs to be examined.
As paradoxical as it appears, we must rid it of all ‘thing-like’
presuppositions. Normally, ‘thing’ designates what is there, already
securely determined, in a closed and unchanging mineral form. You can
point to it; and it is always awaiting designation, ‘object’, as it is
called, separable and separated. Leave this usual sense; and think
rather of the two Greek words that we can translate by ‘thing’;
<em>chrema</em> and <em>pragma</em>, and try to think of them together.
The first designates that which is made use of; the second that which
requires an action and responds to it. If we agree to give the name
‘thing itself’ to that which designates the two together, we can say
that by this name is understood that which worries us and sets our
actions in motion: thus, the sea for whoever swims in it, the air for
whoever breathes, the earth for whoever places their feet on it. In a
certain way, the ‘thing itself’ is always inhabited by whoever is
concerned with it. It manifests itself as its ‘element’, and the latter
finds itself immersed in it, so to speak. It is thus that long ago in a
famous verse (‘thought and existence are the same thing’) Parmenides
said of being that it is the element of thought, in the same way that
the air is the element of the bird, the sea that of the swimmer. And
this same Parmenides added: ‘Without the being where its expansion is
located, you could not find thought.’</p>
<p>To free the expressive capacity (the <em>logos</em>, to use the word
consecrated by tradition) residing in the thing itself where
mathematical activity is immersed, this is, it seems to me, Gilles
Châtelet’s project. From this follows the look, altogether new, that he
casts towards the ‘history’, in many ways common to all three, of
mathematics, of physics an of metaphysics. From this also follow the
remarkable periods that he picks out and to which he devotes himself:
Oresme and the <em>latitudo formarum</em> (the extensivity of forms);
Argand and the unfolding of the complex plane; Kant and the
‘naturalness’ of negative ‘magnitudes’; Faraday and the geometry of the
immanent in magnetic fields; Grassmann and the journey from the polar to
the axial as the seed of an unfolding of dimensions; Hamilton and the
appearance of an algebra capable of expressing the forms of such an
unfolding; Schelling (and more generally Romantic idealism) as the
bringing to light of the virtual realities that guarantee the unitary
life of nature and the intellect.</p>
<p>These choices are not arbitrary. Nor are they the result of a
preconceived thesis on the part of Gilles Châtelet regarding the course
(or teleology) of the ‘history’ of mathematics. They suggested
themselves to him as a result of the profound nature of his particular
experience as a mathematician-philosopher. They express his unmistakable
way of finding himself immersed in the ‘thing itself’, which demands his
most attentive care: that in which he invests himself principally as a
<em>zoon noon echon</em> (as a ‘living creature endowed with
intellect’), we might say, to repeat with minor modification Aristotle’s
traditional proposition, that is to say in the ‘mathematical
element’.</p>
<p>‘Invested’ should be taken here, it seems to me, in its strongest
sense: involved bodily, in the place where he is directly inserted into
the heart of the visible. ‘The virtual demands the gesture’, he writes.
Here is something to make us pause for a moment. This is where the crux
of the matter is: in the unbreakable connection of the particular body
(as the seed of motion), the virtual and the visible.</p>
<p>And, in fact, this monadic body, which we call ‘our own’, is always
attended by the mobile horizon of its virtual sites. Everything happens
for this body as if a cortege of ghostly bodies, all equally its own,
always followed it and always preceded it, marking out its possible
places of occupation, according to a form of spacing out which is
unfolded within it and by it. Thus, I move through the streets of a
familiar town. A crows surrounds me: others — bodies — who also move. I
see some of them from the back; others in profile; others face on. In
turn they see me. Or at least I behave as though I were seen by them. In
my turn I could put myself where I see them, in the place that they
occupied and from which they saw me. That they could have seen me in the
way that I saw them is inscribed in the singular mode of existence of my
body. In this sense, my body-for-the-other, my body which is visible
from an elsewhere, is constitutive of the form of presence for me of the
body that I call mine. So much so that in this reciprocal relation of
spacing the site where each person is inscribed at the present time is
for the other his virtual site, the sign of a possible presence, which
could also, inasmuch as it is that of another, hide his own. The
anonymous corporeality of the Other always inhabits the mode of presence
of all particular bodies and prints there the mark of a virtual
ubiquity, without which no ‘positioning in space’ would be possible.</p>
<p>It is in this horizon, which is always in process of being spaced
out, that the modes of objectification are constituted according to
which we learn to deal with the ‘corporeal things’, always assigned to
the virtuality of their sites, that our ghostly bodies inhabit, figures
of the virtual ubiquity innate to the particular body of each. If we
agree to give the name of ‘seed of dialectic’ to any connection of
differences maintained in a state of tension within the particular form
of their coexistence, we will say of any relation between virtualities
that it constitutes such a seed. Consequently, any ‘thing’, however
immobile and inert i may appear, consists of the unity of two
‘virtualities’: that of its site relative to another thing; and that of
itself relative to its site. The ‘virtualities’ echo one another and, in
truth, each indicates the other and therefore maintains itself only
through this surmounted difference. From this it follows that a point is
fundamentally disquieting.</p>
<p>If I write these strange words, it is because I allow myself to be
carried along by the dreams that Gilles Châtelet’s work has produced in
me. Indeed, I dreamed a great deal in the course of my reading: I
projected myself into my phantom bodies; I was Ampère’s ‘bonhomme’; I
was the inhabitant of Einstein’s lift; I was an ‘event’ in Minkowski’s
cone. Now, I was actually nowhere other than on my chair in front of my
table. What have I discovered then, if not this: the open field of
virtual ubiquity of my own body, without which the world itself would be
but absence and without which consequently nothing that we call
‘mathematical’ would ever have come to us.</p>
<p>When I finished reading, I was still dreaming. Of Kant and of his
‘first’ of whom he speaks, who ‘may have demonstrated the isosceles
triangle’, of Husserl also and his ‘protogeometer’. And I asked myself
the question, how can I imagine this ‘first’? Where do I place him? And
in what world? I do not imagine somebody doing calculations, or even a
busy surveyor; rather, someone of leisure, sitting in front of the sea,
under an olive or fig tree. He would have closed his eyes and begun to
dream: to travel in the virtual universe of phantom bodies. The
strangest traces would become visible to him. Criss-crosses,
unravelings, knots, ruptures, retracings, comings and goings. He would
delight in the spectacle, even with his motionless body. He would open
his eyes — would see the light hitting the sand and, with his finger,
would trace there some lines in order to retain something of this
saraband. Perhaps he would think that he had slept and dreamed. But,
Homeric reader, he would rejoice all the more for this. <em>To gar onar
ek Dios esti</em>, ‘for the dream comes from Zeus’. The journey, he
would think, is more real than crude light.</p>
<p>That is how Châtelet leads me to imagine the ‘first’ geometer. Which
is enough to make one rejoice to become a mathematician.</p>
