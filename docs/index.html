<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This book will try to draw the moral of a vaudeville play with three protagonists — the mathematician, the physicist and the philosopher — whose disputes have animated various debates about ideas for two centuries. It is true that in the last decade things have taken a different shape. Our three protagonists would now perhaps hesitate a little longer before taking up their traditional attitudes.</p>
<p>The mathematician might not be so willing to play the fierce defender of the autonomy of structures, contemptuously ignoring nudges from an experimental ‘reality’ that would make his speculations tangible.</p>
<p>The ‘working physicist’ would certainly cling less tightly to the facile certainties of a dualism between ‘model’ and ‘reality’. Not so long ago, there was no question of the field worker wasting time playing around with the pretty structures, too ‘sophisticated to be found in Nature’, emanating from mathematicians’ brains. For many ordinary practitioners of the exact sciences, mathematics was only a ‘tool’. But why does the latter work so well? It would appear that this question is no longer only a matter of interest for the aesthetes of philosophy. Wigner, Einstein, Heisenberg and many others would also certainly have shunned the ‘pragmatism’ of our ordinary practitioners. What hand is holding the tool? What gestures are involved in this ‘functioning’, which establishes a higher form of continuity between ‘structure’ and ‘reality’? Is it simply a case of ‘applying’ mathematics to physics or rather of awakening the physical in mathematics? Indeed, there is quite enough to exasperate even the most patient of understandings: the triumph of the operation is always accompanied by a sort of mystification, the ‘hand’ seems to become increasingly invisible and the ‘application’ very quickly forgets the gestures that it mobilizes.</p>
<p>Which leaves the philosopher, who is always suspected of being the fly in the ointment. However, he long ago gave up trying to have the benefit of the last word. In any case, he hates having to make up his mind, which is why he is accused of abandoning himself too readily to lazy meditations on the ‘problematic’ and even of succumbing to the seductions of hermeneutics. Does he pride himself on fundamentals? On such occasions he is rightly reproached for mixing up logic and mathematics, for reducing the latter to a formal game and confusing it with the administration of proofs by letting himself become intoxicated with the certainties of syntax.</p>
<p>It should be acknowledged that the philosopher’s task is not the simplest: it is difficult to drive a wedge between the ‘metaphorical’ and the ‘operational’. He will therefore feel the pressure of the combined forces of art and science and will be the object of two opposed temptations: to give himself over to sweeping surveys, having absolved himself of the responsibility of the patient examination of the concept, or, which is much more often the case and much worse, become the humble major domo of scientists, who are assumed to be in possession of the only really ‘serious’ truths, and thus to confine himself ‘modestly’ to a role of formal policing. Sad destiny for philosophy: the discipline that formerly sat at the head of the table finds itself reduced to the role of a Cinderella taken up with ‘verification’ and its thrilling problems of directing the circulation of commonsensical ideas!</p>
<p>Cinderella can also seek forgiveness for her anxiety when faced with ‘calculations’ by showing her devotion through persevering with rearguard justifications reconciling technique with humanism. This scientifico-charitable approach claims to introduce the ‘educated’ public to certain spectacular results, which are deemed too abstract and which seem to collide head-on with common sense. Mr. Prudhomme<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> adores our Cinderella and her ‘ethical’ generalizations. The latter inform greatly without giving offence and bring science into the realm of the ‘everyday’. the angel of the bizarre is at last reconciled with the security of common sense! Our good man declares himself surprised and even ‘interested’ by these Great Problems, particularly by these little butterflies that call determinism into question at the North Pole by beating their wings in the tropics. After his visit to the cabinet of curiosities, Mr. Prudhomme leaves stimulated and reassured; he has been able to confirm ‘for himself’ what he has suspected for a long time: after all, these Great Problems are not so far removed from his own little problems; all’s well that ends well and everyone can sleep easy; <em>at root, this is just like that.</em></p>
<p>To consolidate these anaesthetic and orthopaedic functions, Cinderella can offer her services in a more subtle manner, by showing hat science, despite its occasional unruliness, might very well be tamed in he great garden of philosophical categories. The public is thus invited to participate in a game of I-Spy: ‘Guess who’s here! Who’s back? Look! Here’s the new figure of Substance. Come this way … The Transcendental grappling the nine-headed hydra of the Empirical to the ground will be familiar to everyone … And over here’s the Dialectic. It’s a bit chipped …’ Naturally, this guided tour of allegories always concludes with a ‘this is just like that’. Our ‘rationalism’, all got up in its Sunday best, doesn’t care much for surprises: for such-and-such a structure, such-and-such a category! Everything will have its place, from the Big Bang to the non-determinist butterfly …</p>
<p>But do we really want Cinderella to be always so zealous, always so impatient to prove her ‘modernity’ and her multidisciplinary good will? Do we really want her to offer science a supplement of soul and play the part of healer woman by taking up conjuring and incantations? Should she dedicate herself to communication and dialectic, and pledge her allegiance to science? Cinderella probably has everything to lose; by agreeing to the tasks of bringing ‘crises’ to heal, plugging gaps and softening paradigms, she finds herself shrunk to the status of ‘a frame for seeing the world’ and being asked to come up with arguments destined to reinforce the artillery of the different ‘schools of interpretation’; is there any need to point out that, when a question has been settled by experiment or arithmetic, our servant is no longer needed?</p>
<p>These remains, however, a confused desire to take up again in the flesh with what is perceived as a whole that has been mutilated by technical dispersement, a genuine nostalgia for magical power, exasperated by the incapacity of classical rationalism to get to grips with all these sleights of hand, all these ‘recipes’, all these thought experiments, these figures and diagrams, all these dynasties of problems seemingly capable of the ‘miracle’ of reactivation. This reactivation is ‘informative’ in the proper sense and cannot be reduced to the conveying of a pre-conceived form from one transmitter to another receiver. It avoids the clichés of vulgarization and scientific ‘journalism’.</p>
<p>It is clear why classical rationalism doesn’t much like to rub against the ‘mystery’ of these practices and these ways of seeing: the latter are applied on precisely the sensitive, the blind, points of the Understanding, at the hinge-horizons where inchoate systems being to unfold, in all those places where orientation can’t be had for free and where the true is not synonymous with the verifiable. The great names of Galois, Faraday, Maxwell, or Heisenberg reverberate — but substances, established categories, structures, objects and forms do not. That is why I will devote myself here, with the aid of some examples, to demonstrating the historical dignity of problems, their dynastic exemplariness that has never been exhausted by acknowledgement or hypothesis of ‘influences’. Gestures and problems mark an epoch and unknown to geometers and philosophers guide the eye and hand.</p>
<p>A thrusting philosophy cannot be content with continual ratiocinations on the ‘status’ of scientific objects. It has to position itself at the outposts of the obscure, looking upon the irrational not as ‘diabolical’ and resistance to articulation, but rather as the means by which new dimensions come into being.</p>
<p>A science that remained obsessed with reference and prediction would be quite incapable of taking up Heidegger’s famous challenge, which is why we want to give due weight here to the function of <em>operative contemplation</em> referred to by Galois, Faraday, Einstein and many others. Any philosophy that deliberately neglected the contemplative pole would soon have to bow to what is operation and ‘feasible’, trying to pacify them with whatever paraphrases and clichés are to hand.</p>
<p>Some contemporary debates seem to see the relationship between science and philosophy only in terms of servility or of perpetual cold-shouldering, forgetting that for the past two and a half millennia in the West, metaphysics, mathematics and physics have always (willy nilly) gone hand in hand. It is a shibboleth of the history of ideas to state that each scientific revolution produces a new paradigm with the more or less explicit assistance of metaphysics. The great scientists of the eighteenth century stated clearly the autonomy and positivity of metaphysical intervention in their work. It was about a common problematic that mathematics, physics and metaphysical speculations were articulated. Each approached the questions in its own fashion, without feeling threatened by its rivals. Scientists and philosophers of the eighteenth century demanded such a community of questions, not to mask lack of technique with a ‘metaphysical stop gap’, but as a means of preventing the separation of the modes of apprehending, acting and feeling.</p>
<p>But it may be that modern philosophy is the only dissenting voice in a dialogue between mathematics and physics which would otherwise be ‘constructive’ and peaceful.</p>
<p>A knowledge, even a summary one, of the history of science demonstrates that the relationship between mathematics — ‘general maid’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (but also queen of the sciences) — and physics — the grubby, efficient cook — has hardly been idyllic. Aristotle saved himself a lot of bother by keeping the enemy sisters under the strict tutelage of theology! But is is a long time now since physics and mathematics liberated themselves — beginning in a fierce ontological rivalry that shows how urgent it is for us to think of their relationship in terms of other that subordination, application, or utilization.</p>
<p>Of course, with or without ‘metaphysics’, precarious deals can be struck: I’ll give you the real, if you give me the fundamental.’ As a result, epistemologies more or less expected to confer official status proliferate: ‘conventionalism’, partisans of mathematical symbolism, partisans of ‘realism’ … They can paraphrase ‘formulae’, hunt down some metaphysical principle ‘at the root of it all’ and reduce mathematics to a ‘language’ that is indifferent to its own content and physics to a construction of ‘models’ furnishing predictions. However, a philosophy that would think physico-mathematics must break through the ‘assumptions’ inscribed in this contract and understand, for example, that giving a mathematical existence to the fulgurations of matter is not to confine a point within a geometrical cell, but instead to learn to welcome all the potentialities of particles, of the ‘physico-monads’. Leibniz gives clearest expression to this reciprocal formulation: ‘My metaphysics is entirely mathematical so to speak, or could become so’, and it is precisely the metaphysical concept of ‘monad’ that makes it possible to understand differential calculus.</p>
<p>How can mathematics, as an ‘exact science’, avoid becoming trapped between the Identical and absolutely Other? How do we make a world from the monads of physics, mathematics, and metaphysics? How are we to conceive this triple cohesion without adopting Aristotle’s theological solution? Husserl is responsible for underlining the philosophical stakes in the elaboration of modern physico-mathematics. Analyses of the <em>krisis</em> show that, if the world is thought of as a mathematical <em>universum</em> (as science has insisted since Galileo), there must be a mode of correspondence between ‘purely geometrical’ acts which involve the world of boundary forms and figures and the acts of material filling. Nature, as a calculable <em>universum</em> assumes the unprecedented violence, of a protocol of agreement between the community of forms and the community of bodies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything that offers itself as real within the specific sensible qualities should have its mathematical index within the processes of the sphere of the form … and thence, an indirect mathematization should become possible in order to construct <em>ex datis</em> all the processes on the side of the fillings.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, this revolutionary coup assumes the dislocation of Aristotle’s tutelage. It also assumes the concept of ‘abstract space’ — not there in the Greeks — capable of absorbing into its homogeneity the world of forms and that of bodies and, finally, the construction of a differential calculus able to apprehend motion by giving a mathematical existence to entities defined by a mode of fading. The complete staging of physico-mathematics therefore leads to the construction of imposing infrastructures which necessarily involve the whole of metaphysics.</p>
<p>At first sight this physico-mathematics does appear to be an axiomatics giving precise form to the system of equivalence between mathematical concepts and physical concepts. To understand the revolutionary coup that installs this axiomatics is to discover the proximity of two horizons made up of virtual determinations which exceed the current set of explicit determinations and which still remain available for examination. Conceived as an apprenticeship, as a Promethean impulse and not as a combinatorial manipulation of beings-in-the-world, or as an ‘abstract game’, mathematics necessarily fulfills itself in physics. It is in these terms that we should understand Galileo’s audacity in daring to bring the boundary forms of pure geometry into contact with the world of moving bodies.</p>
<p>Let’s give some examples.</p>
<p>Quantification confirmed the community of the particular horizons of analytic mechanics and of the theory of abstract spaces on the one hand and of those of chemistry and atomic spaces on the other. The discrete affinities of electrochemistry expressly required a field of operation that was really irreducible to a homogeneous continuum (Bohr’s orbits, where the electron does not radiate, already implicitly acknowledged this). At the beginning of the twentieth century, functional spaces constitute a theme in which the mathematician’s attention focuses much more on the play of the operators itself than on the substrate that the latter are supposed to shape. A geometrical language (Hilbert’s ‘spaces’) accompanies this play and tends to give it an autonomous contemplative pole and to forge the idea of a <em>functional figural</em> (‘cone’ of functions, spectrum, etc.). It is precisely this autonomy that was granted to the operators that allows them to be recognized as ‘observables’ in quantum mechanics. Paradoxical result: it is the motion itself of the amplifying abstraction of mathematics that governs their incarnation as physical beings: <em>the more ‘abstract’ mathematics is, the better it works in application</em>. Thus, to establish a new mathematical physics is to be capable of recognizing to what extent such an effort of radical autonomy in mathematics necessarily involves the horizon of the virtualities of physics.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example: the scandal caused by the discourse of the non-Euclidean geometers in the nineteenth century is well known. We can hail this event as the complete liberation of geometry, ‘freed’ at last from the physical universe; it was down to the metaphysical genius of Riemann to sense the enormity of what was at stake in the existence of such geometries. In fact, Euclidean geometry’s assumption of unicity was inherited from the covenant of classical mathematical physics: affine Euclidean space is ‘our’ space and the plurality, now acknowledged, of geometric worlds implied that the very effort of invention which had conceived them should also penetrate the horizon of physics. Conceived by Riemann and Gauss as being associated with a theory of the inhabiting of surfaces, the concepts of modern geometry (connection, curvature) can be fully realized as potentials and as forces. It is from this point of view that we should assess the efforts of Gauge Theory. What is at stake in the latter is not so much the discovery of the formula that will ‘finally’ condense the equivalence of natural forces, but the ‘physical’ understanding of worlds in general to pure mobility, an effort derived from the vacillation of the categories of the ‘purely geometrical’ and the ‘purely physical’.</p>
<p>It is true, however, that there is always something scandalous about revealing the physical existence of this or that concept that was previously grasped as the ‘purely mathematical’. Mathematics never functions as a simple tool for the physicist and is indifferent to its status as ‘queen of the exact sciences’ in which it is sometimes got up out of mistrust and envy. Because its axiomatics cannot be reduced to a stock of data and rules for creating formal enunciations, modern mathematics becomes more and more explicitly capable of inhabiting the horizon of its virtualities and therefore of reactivating itself. We shouldn’t forget that Lautman showed that the most technical theorems can involve categories that are deemed to be strictly philosophical and that Bachelard knew that ‘the association of operators produces living words, thought-out sentences, thinking sentences’; in this sense, the physico-mathematical involves thought otherwise than would the ‘pure and simple’ translation of a physical ‘content’ into a mathematical ‘language’. Particles do not present themselves as things, as beings-in-the-world that are simply ‘available’ (Heidegger’s <em>Vorhandenheit</em>) and modern physics leads us close to the geometrical origin of thought. If Leibniz can articulate causality and the differential it is because the latter is not a simple tool or even a paradigm, and if potential can claim the crucial status that is henceforth associated to it in physical theories, it is because it has always retained a certain ontological dignity, even if it was, until quite recently, sacrificed as a mere intermediary element in calculation.</p>
<p>The great founders of physics revealed in the order of the calculable the cohesion of both physical and mathematical horizons by means of an axiomatics. There remain unexplored some problematic cores that are not directly involved in the arsenal of assumptions and equivalences made possible by this axiomatics. Thus, two very different rhythms underpin the ‘history of ideas’: the first is intermittent and consists of ‘ruptures’, of paradigms and their refutations; the second is quieter but is still open to reactivation, and consists of a rumination, a motionless worrying of the problematic cores.</p>
<p>This possibility of reactivating and welcoming the problematic as such implies that today’s physico-mathematics really has ‘metaphysics’ under its skin and therefore is of concern to the philosopher. He must know that there are no ultimate truths (since it is not the truths but the problems that are reactivated) and ignore any lamenting of a ‘real’, the truth of which conceals itself ‘behind’ the calculations. What becomes increasingly unlikely, by the favour of God, is the possibility of burying questions with our common sense and of ‘having done’ with them once and for all.</p>
<p>Metaphysics does have a catalytic effect, which has been described in a very beautiful text by the mathematician Andre Weil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more fertile, all mathematicians know, than these obscure analogies, these murky reflections of one theory in another, these furtive caresses, these inexplicable tiffs; also nothing gives as much pleasure to the researcher. A day comes when the illusion vanishes: presentiment turns into certainty … Luckily for researchers, as the fogs clear at one point, they form again at another.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andre Weil cuts to the quick here: he conjures these ‘murky reflections’, these ‘furtive caresses’, the ‘theory of Galois that Lagrange touches … with his finger through a screen that he does not manage to pierce.’ He is a connoisseur of these metaphysical ‘fogs’ whose dissipation at one point heralds their reforming at another. It would be better to talk here of a horizon that tils thereby revealing a new space of gestures which has not as yet been elucidated and cut out as structure.</p>
<p>A mathematician of this calibre is aware that science supports itself on two crutches:</p>
<ul>
<li>the official crutch of the literal text, which accounts for the carrying out of the operations and which guarantees the transmission of knowledge;</li>
<li>a more subtle crutch, reserved for initiates, who are able to sense a whole network of allusions interlaced with the literal text and continually overflowing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the point where the reactivation of the gestures that multiply knowledge is acted out and where the passage from premonition to certainty is fomented.</p>
<p>In its ordinary work and communication, science pretends to lean mainly on the first crutch. Hence, it is quite possible to anticipate, predict, store up data and above all to carry out operations, that is to say to make the best of the artificial disjunction of product and productivity; we forget the roughness of the conquest of homogeneity required by the operation in order to ensure the exteriority of its relationship to its parameters. There is a sort of unrewarding prudishness about the clarity of the operation; it always strives to conceal the gesture that cuts out a form of articulation — a liaison or a function; it forgets that this gesture unfolds while unwittingly arousing another articulation (the fulcrum of its lever arm). The artifice that creates a form always has a blind spot: ‘If a fog clears at one point, it reforms on another.’</p>
<p>Fear of the irrational undoubtedly feeds our lack of knowledge, but above all on those points of omission, on a certain impatience that keeps us from penetrating to the heart of the operative by confusing learning with the talent for rapidly consuming an ‘informational content’. But to learn is to prepare oneself to learn what one in some way already knows, and to put oneself into such a state where the connection between things reverberates in the connection of the mind. The operation is not at first given as an arrow that links a source to a target, but rather emerges in the places where variables become merged and get tangled up without being policed by parentheses.</p>
<p>This is the beating heart of operativity, this is where the relation given implicitly as a ‘curve’ <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q(x,y)=0</annotation></semantics></math> can be attained, where determination envelops itself and then liberates, in its singular points, external relations — ‘parametric’ relations or a ‘function’ of the type <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y=P(x)</annotation></semantics></math>, where the separation between the two sides of the equation — therefore between datum and result — is already consummated. Here the gestures of cutting and what they carry off with them can be grasped, testifying that science does not think like philosophy, but that it is concerned with thought without allowing itself to be reduced to a refutable prejudice. Here the reverberation, the learning of learning, can be approached; here that strange capacity of Science to draw its power from its very partiality can be illuminated; here the difference between the knowledge of beings and what makes it reverberate becomes flagrant.</p>
<p>This is why logicism, like a mathematics applied to the calculation of the liaisons between propositions and to the administration of proof, cannot claim to reach the status of that which marks an epoch within the development of physico-mathematical knowledge. There can indeed exist ‘objects’ whose formal definition is impeccable and allows problem-free operation, but whose presentation, by a new notation, shakes up a whole mathematical continent. An obvious example is that of the ‘rediscovery’ of imaginary numbers by the introduction of the plane (see chapter III). If, solely from the point of view of mathematical logic, the discovery is trite, this fresh encounter of the geometric with the algebraic (and therefore of the visible with the calculable) will dictate the works of Hamilton and Riemann (and many others), at the same time as having an impact on the very notion of the application of mathematics: physics, geometry and algebra will cooperate to make up a real electromagnetic space, which will continue to inspire the most contemporary research.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for philosophy to penetrate further into the straits where the figures tracing contemplation and the formulae actualizing operations of determination are articulated. But these represent a strategic place already haunted by two other combatants on the battlefront of the obscure: art and science. Here, metaphor begins the process of shedding its skin that will metamorphose it into operation, and hence it is that this nook swarms with clichés that strive to invite us to view a rediscovered operativity.</p>
<p>Cliché dissolves the gesture that patiently managed to trace out an identity of relations into a relation of resemblance; it thus claims to soften the technical nature of the operation and its ‘cold’ exteriority by a warm confusion. But such clichés always come too late! They will always be depreciated as ‘metaphorical’ and denounced for usurping the operation’s prestigious place. Superstitions have nothing to fear from this poor man’s operativity which leaves the operation’s exteriority intact. Cliché poses no challenge to the arrogance of the functional, but sets out to disallow any thought that is at all conceptual. Witness, the puerile display evoked by such concepts as the big bang (which never stops starting), chaos (which neutralizes everything), catastrophe (which no longer frightens many people), the fractal (fascinating above all to minds of a simpler understanding), chance (of which it is well known that God has a horror), etc.</p>
<p>In the section of his <em>Méthode axiomatique et formalisme</em> dedicated to physical experiments, Jean Cavaillès demands that we should rediscover ‘the central intuition … which constitutes the profound unity — but this time graspable in action — of a theory.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This concept of <em>gesture</em> seems to us crucial in our approach to the amplifying abstraction of mathematics, which eludes rationalizing paraphrases — always too slow — metaphors and their confused fascinations and finally, above all, formal systems that would like to buckle shut a grammar of gestures: Gödel has demonstrated that rebellious statements — ones that are true, but not provable — are immediately produced by any syntax that is at all ambitious.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>This gesture does not allow itself to be ‘captured’ in front of us — it does not throw out bridges between us and things — nor ‘behind’ us — no algorithm controls its staging. It would be better to speak of a propulsion, which gathers itself up again in an impulse, of a single gesture that strips a structure bare and awakens in us other gestures.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to emphasize that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the gesture is not substantial: it gains amplitude by determining itself. Its sovereignty is equal to its penetration and that is why we refer to the gesture’s ‘accuracy’: the precision of the strike is proof of the reverberation of its skill. The gesture inaugurates a family of gestures, whereas the rule only enunciates ‘instructions’, a protocol for decomposing the action into endlessly repeatable acts. The gesture possesses a historical exemplariness: if one can speak of an <em>accumulation</em> of knowledge over the course of successive generations, one should speak of gestures inaugurating dynasties of problems;</li>
<li>the gesture is not a simple spatial displacement: it decides, liberates, and suggests a new modality of ‘moving oneself’. Hugues de Saint-Victor defined the gesture as ‘the motion and figuration of the members of the body according to the measure and modalities of all action and attitude.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The gesture refers to a disciplined distribution of mobility before any transfer takes place: one is infused with the gesture before knowing it;</li>
<li>the gesture is elastic, it can crouch on itself, leap beyond itself and reverberate, where the function gives only the form of the transit from one external term to another external term, where the act exhausts itself in its result. The gesture is therefore involved with the implicit pole of the relation;</li>
<li>the gesture envelopes before grasping and sketches its unfolding long before denoting or exemplifying: already domesticated gestures are the ones that serve as references;</li>
<li>a gesture awakens other gestures: it is able to store up all the allusion’s provocative virtualities, without debasing it into abbreviation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will come as no surprise then that we pay particular attention to the dynasties of gestures of cutting out, to diagrams that capture them mid-flight, to thought experiments. We will hunt out the hingeing point at which principles become unstable, we will seek out the constructed symmetrizing devices and reveal the less expected dissymmetry that orients a more radical project.</p>
<p>A diagram can transfix a gesture, bring it to rest, long before it curls up into a sign, which is why modern geometers and cosmologers like diagrams with their peremptory power of evocation. They capture gestures mid-flight; for those capable of attention, they are the moments where being is glimpsed smiling. Diagrams are in a degree the accomplices of poetic metaphor. But they are a little less impertinent — it is always possible to seek solace in the mundane plotting of their thick lines — and more faithful: they can prolong themselves into an operation which keeps them from becoming worn out. Like the metaphor, they leap out in order to create spaces and reduce gaps: they blossom with dotted lines in order to engulf images that were previously figured in thick lines. But unlike the metaphor the diagram is not exhausted: if it immobilizes a gesture in order to set down an operation, it does so by sketching a gesture that then cuts out another. The dotted line refers neither to the point and its discrete destination, nor to the line and its continuous trace, but to the pressure of the virtuality (see chapter I) that worries the already available image in order to create space for a new dimension: the diagram’s mode of existence is such that its genesis is comprised in its being. We could describe this as a technique of allusions.</p>
<p>We know how Gilbert Simondon managed to illuminate processes of convergence and adaptation of the gesture into a technique which make it possible to speak of a technical line of descent.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> There are therefore families of diagrams of increasingly precise and ambitious allusions, just as there are lines of descent that are increasingly autonomous and concrete, and, just as the technical object does not follow knowledge, so the diagram does not simply illustrate or translate an already available content. The diagrams are therefore concerned with experience and reveal themselves capable of appropriating and conveying ‘all this talking with the hands’ (which it would perhaps be better to call this talking <em>in</em> the hands) of which physicists are so proud and which they naturally reserve for the initiates. A philosophy of the physico-mathematical cannot ignore this symbolic practice which is prior to formalism, this practice of condensation and amplification of the intuition.</p>
<p>We will see, in chapter I in particular, how Oresme’s diagrams defy the fearful logical course uttered by Aristotle against all thought concerning motion. Taking advantage of the distinction made by Avicenna and Giles of Rome between virtual and dimensional quantities, these diagrams seize each motion like the articulation of three panels (a ‘triptych’) and endow the determination with plasticity. Like the gesture, they also avoid the dilemma of a substance which only gains in comprehension what it loses in extension. They also show that ontological measurement is not a simple external observable, but the living relationship that intermingles an intensity (the ‘ontological’ pole of measurement) and two extensive qualities.</p>
<p>It is not only a question of historically acknowledging a subsidiary ‘tool’ for representing equations, but of appreciating the considerable stakes of an ontological dignity particular to the figural which made kinematics and analytical geometry possible long before the discovery of differential calculus. These diagrams take their place in a line of descent that runs from Avicenna to Leibniz and therefore prepare for what Heidegger calls modern science’s project of the mathematical questioning of Nature. It is no exaggeration to speak of the historical resonance of these diagrams, which abolish the rigid division between algebra, which clarified the determination operations of variables, and geometry, whose figures ensured the protection of the contemplative.</p>
<p>The diagram never goes out of fashion: it is a project that aims to apply exclusively to what it sketches; this demand for autonomy makes it the natural accomplice of thought experiments.</p>
<p>The thought experiment does not claim to predict or verify a law, nor to tackle the causality of things head-on; it seeks rather to avoid it, to do away with weighty truths and available intuitions. If it is ‘ideal’ or ‘theoretical’, it is not because it is impossible to carry out with ‘real’ instruments, but because it claims to question or uncover processes of idealization. In its way it is very practical: it is the test by which the physicist-philosopher takes upon himself to lose his bearings, to know the perplexity inherent in any situation were discernment is by no means self-evident. It is a matter for him of arranging a subversion of the habits associated with sensible clichés (‘reality’ thus deciding for him) and of transporting himself through thought into precincts beyond causality sheltered from forces, to let himself float between mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>This is how Galileo imagines ‘a body launched on a horizontal plane in the absence of all obstacle’ and remarks that ‘the motion of the body will continue uniformly and eternally on this same plane, provided that it is infinitely prolonged.’<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the same way Einstein isolates himself in a lift to shatter the cliché of a recipient-form welcoming a living matter and to see the free emergence of the tenuous hinge that joins them. It is a matter of staging the most complete state of disorientation in order to orient and assert a physico-mathematical project that will appear, <em>thereafter</em>, as the most obvious. We have already noted that learning was above all a preparation for learning what one already knew. It could be said that the thought experiment also aims at putting one in such a state that it becomes obvious that this principle or that identity (even where contradicted by ‘real’ experience) is the most ‘natural’. This ‘naturalness’ seems to defy all contingency and to belong to the order of the inevitable: Galileo knew that ‘inevitably’ objects fell through a vacuum at the same speed, without having experienced it.</p>
<p>One could even say that the radical thought experiment is an experiment where Nature and the Understanding switch places. Galileo sometimes puts himself in Nature’s place, which, in its simplicity, could not have chosen to ‘move at an inconceivable speed an immense number of very large bodies, to produce a result for which the moderate movement of a single body turning around its own centre would suffice’.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Einstein was in the habit of saying that it was necessary to put oneself in God’s place to understand Nature. There is nothing surprising therefore in these teleportations where Einstein takes himself for a photon and positions himself on the horizon of velocities (see chapter II), in these immersions where Archimedes, in his bathtub, imagines that his body is nothing but a gourd of water. Thus, to understand the photon, it is necessary to become a photon and, to understand floating, it is necessary to turn oneself into a wineskin! The thought experiment taken to its conclusion is a <em>diagrammatic</em> experiment in which it becomes clear that a diagram is for itself its own experiment. The gestures that it captures and particularly those that it arouses are no longer directed towards things, but take their place in a line of diagrams, within a technical development; thus Oresme’s rectangles are swallowed up by the perspective projection of restrained relativity (see chapter II), the magnet closes upon itself in a circuit (see chapter V), loops transform themselves into helices.</p>
<p>There are certain devices, deliberately productive of ambiguity, which give rise to thought experiments that penetrate closer to the heart of relation and operativity; we call them <em>allusive devices</em> and the last three chapters (III, IV, V) are taken up with their study. An allusive stratagem compresses and unfolds, but is not the same as either an abbreviation or an explanation. From the end of the eighteenth century, philosophers and scientists will compete with one another in France, England and Germany to solve the mystery of the birth of polarities and discovery a <em>spatial</em> negativity whose fecundity Kant had sense in two crucial articles (‘what Is It to Orient Oneself in Thought?’ and the ‘Attempt to Introduce into Philosophy the Concept of Negative Quantity’).</p>
<p>This spatial negativity, too neglected by the history of philosophy (especially in its concern with the work of the negative in a perspective of temporality and historicity), plays a crucial role in the emergence of dimension, as much in <em>Naturphilosophie</em> as in the discovery of new connections between algebra and geometry or in the development of electromagnetic theories. It was necessary, however, to note that the science of the nineteenth century, form Argand to Grassman and Maxwell, could understand the negative as a positional relation in order to drive on its redoubtable offensive against extended spatiality and its dead distances. Allusive devices are capable of appropriating all the lateral mobilities involved in an orientation and of discharging longitudinal forces (‘naturally’ identified with an operativity that moves from one boundary to another or from one point to another) in favour of ‘latitudinal’ (transverse) forces that are linked to a diffusion of dimension. These devices can be thought of as ‘dialectical balances’; unstable balances that are only upset when carrying off a more ample space. They bring to light an indifference centre (the eye of the cyclone), a pivot point that commands a network of symmetries whose breakage leads to a finer degree of discernment.</p>
<p>Such is our interpretation of a dialectical immanence: dialectic is not the synthetic neutralization of two pre-existing and opposed terms, but the discovery of the articulation that opens out the dimension along which they will surge like ‘sides’. This explains our interest (see chapter V) in diagrams associated with the conquest of dimension: iron horseshoe magnets, corkscrews, helices, etc. They show that orientation cannot be reduced to a simple ‘choice’ and possesses an effectivity that involves geometry and physics as much as metaphysics. They suggest a discipline of gestures and give rise to thought experiments that are articulated long before any formalizing grasp.</p>
<p>We will study in particular the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grassmann’s theory of the extension (see chapter IV) and the definition of non-commutative products, where the question of orientation plays a crucial role;</li>
<li>Hamilton’s spatial square roots (see chapter V), which overcome the duality of translations and rotations;</li>
<li>the axis-loop systems of Ampere, Faraday, and Maxwell, which show that the secret of what it is as well to call electrogeometry is linked to the possibility of capturing the ambiguity that arises when one tries to produce the ‘axial’ (rotational lateral forces) from the polar. This ambiguity succeeds, by its twists and unscrewings, in loosening up the ‘natural’ character of the extensive divisions which accompany the mechanistic understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stratagems grasp the operation at its very birth, which is the ambition of any theory of singularities. This theory proposes to master the points at which the canonical choice of a parameter — which allows distance to be travelled and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y=f(t)</annotation></semantics></math> to be written — no longer ‘goes without saying’. These points therefore necessitate the invention of a continuum which is able to welcome all the solutions of an algebraic or functional equation. These ‘manifolds’ are cherished by the geometer like a miniature Nature that retains and condenses a geometrical gestuality which it is fitting to appropriate. Thus a new type of intuition is born which does not ‘rely on’ the abstract figures of the sensible world, but aims at experimenting with surfaces (Gauss’ geometry) or even at deforming them (Riemann’s modules). Allusive devices are not limited to the adult relation in the process of ‘functioning’, that is to say of proliferating into sequences of terms which should be wrapped in parentheses according to a pre-established rule, but of harnessing thought experiments — geometrical or physical — that furnish the relation as a curve or as a prejudice innocent of all causality.</p>
<p>With these devices, science has in its possession pieces of evidence that attest, better than the quantitative infinities or the most exotic multiplicities of set theory, that it masters the infinite. This is where vigil is kept by the scars of fierce and ample gestures which are never ‘produced’, but rather cut out the forms, set up and separate the axes, position themselves on the horizons, immobilize that which, ‘by definition’, is supposed to be mobile, posit the sign ‘=’ that separates and links the two ‘sides’ of an equation, impose a rhythm of unfurling — a ‘parameter’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> — on the most headstrong of compact unities.</p>
<p>In its ordinary functioning, science seems to limit itself to the gestures that guarantee the preservation of knowledge and leave undisturbed the patrimony of those that set it alight and multiply it. Those are also the ones that save it from indefinite accumulation and stratification, form the childishness of established positivities, from the comfort of the transits of the ‘operational’ and, finally, from the temptation of allowing itself to be buckled up in a grammar. They illustrate the urgency of an authentic way of conceiving information which would not be committed solely by communication, but would aim at a rational grasp of allusion and of the learning of learning. The latter, of course, would be far removed from the neuronal barbarism which exhausts itself in hunting down the recipient of the thought and in confusing learning with a pillaging of informational booty. Schelling perhaps saw more clearly: he knew that thought was not always encapsulated within the brain, that it could be everywhere … outside … in the morning dew.</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>A. Weil, ‘De la métaphysique aux mathématiques’, <em>Œuvres</em>, vol. II, p. 408. We give here a fuller extract: ‘Eighteenth-century mathematicians were in the habit of speaking of the “metaphysics of the infinitesimal calculation”, of the “metaphysics of the theory of equations”. They understood by these a group of vague analogies, difficult to grasp and difficult to formulate, which nonetheless seemed to them to play an important role at a given moment in mathematical research and discovery. Were they calumniating “true” metaphysics by borrowing its name to designate what, in their science, was least clear? I will not seek to elucidate this point. In any case, the word will have to be understood here in their sense; I will take care not to touch on “real” metaphysics. Nothing is more fertile, as all mathematicians know, than these obscure analogies, these murky reflections of one theory in another, these furtive caresses, these inexplicable tiffs; also nothing gives greater pleasure to the researcher. A day comes when the illusion vanishes; presentiment turns into certainty; twin theories reveal their common source before disappearing; as the <em>Gita</em> teaches, one attains knowledge and indifference at the same time. Metaphysics has become mathematics, ready to form matter with a treatise whose cold beauty can no longer move us. Thus we know what Lagrange was trying to divine when he talked of metaphysics in connection with his own work in algebra; it is Galois’ theory, which he almost lays his finger on, through a screen that he does not manage to pierce. Where Lagrange saw analogies, we see theorems. But the latter can only find expression by means of notions and “structures” which for Lagrange were not yet mathematical objects: groups, bodies, isomorphisms, automorphisms, all this needed to be conceived and defined. Insofar as Lagrange only sensed these notions, insofar as he strives in vain to achieve their substantial unity through the multiplicity of their changing incarnations, he remains caught in metaphysics. At least he finds there the guiding thread that allows him to pass from one problem to another, to bring the materials on site, to put everything in order in provision for the future general theory. Thanks to the decisive notion of the group, with Galois it all becomes mathematical. In the same way again, we see the analogies between the calculus of finite differences and the differential calculus serve as a guide to Leibniz, Taylor and Euler, during the heroic period in which Berkely could say, with as much humour as aptnes, that the “believers” in infinitesimal calculus were little qualified to criticize the obscurizes of the mysteries of the Christian religion, the one being at least as full of mysteries as the other. A little later, d’Alambert, enemy to all metaphysics in mathematics as elsewhere, maintained in his articles in the <em>Encyclopédie</em> that the truth metaphysics of infinitesimal calculus was no other than the notion of the boundary. If he did not himself take as much from this idea as it was possible of yielding, the developments of the following century proved him right; and nothing could be clearer today, nor, it must be said, more tedious, than a correct demonstration of the elements of differential and integral calculus. Luckily for researchers, as the fogs clear at one point, they form again at another.’<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
